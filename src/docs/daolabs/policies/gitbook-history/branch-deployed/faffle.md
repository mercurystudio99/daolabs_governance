+**We are stewards**. We respect with humility the opportunity to help build on the open internet together, and are dedicated to using our capabilities for good.
+
+**We are self-starters.** The decision to make the world a better place does start with expecting someone else to solve this problem, we have to prioritize this for ourselves and facilitate enabling those around us.
+
+**We are focused.** Nontrivial amounts of crypto was entrusted to us, to both use as the community and DAO would benefit the most short term, as well as how to strategize and invest in the crypto community at large for the long term.
+
+**We are builders.** The company we keep are individuals who prioritize building, and do so with pride. Whether it is a community strategy or smart contract auditing for the next emoji poop accessory play to earn mechanic - we build with humility and to make the world a better place.
+
+**We are honest.** With each other, most of all to ourselves. We share ideas, feelings, concerns and exchange everything in between openly and respectfully to each other.

+# üë©‚Äçüíª DevCommunity
+
+Development of the Movement DAO has occurred primarily following fronts
+
+* Feature specific smart contract and Typescript stand-alone cli application
+* Implemented as part of the [Tribute Labs DAO Framework](https://medium.com/@OpenLawOfficial/introducing-the-tribute-dao-framework-3f2f0ed50d62)
+
+The system requirements spanning on-boarding a community with tokens, an interface for governance, and the range of adapters contemplated for communities is expansive. Complicating matters is the constant evolution of tooling and deployment options. Nonetheless, our goal is to enable individuals and communities with the best tools to bootstrap their treasury and follow through until they have a token with liquidity.
+
+To that end we have partnered when possible with existing Open Source teams and contributed code to extend the development experience.
+
+**Movement DAO is actively looking to work with talented web3 developers who are excited to revolutionize how communities manage their treasuries!**
+
+All developer coordination happens on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/movexyz) ‚Äì we recommend connecting directly with the community driven development team there.

+# üíª Github

+The Movement DAO benefited from the thousands of hours of open source work from a number of communities. To that end, the team reviewed a number of existing successful Open Source projects in order to extend the features which were important in furthering the community endowment model.

+### Forking
+
+> "Forking is the highest form of flattery," said @tankbottoms.
+
+[Juicebox](https://juicebox.money/#/), has the most thoughtful community defined programmable funded treasury which is enjoying success with the [Shark DAO](https://juicebox.money/#/p/sharkdao) and [Constitution DAO](https://juicebox.money/#/p/constitutiondao) from the funding to raw awareness. Relatively short amount of time since launch, JBX-Protocol has a significant treasury and tremendous success with the community. But we think it could do more.
+
+Additionally, the [Tribute Labs](https://mirror.xyz/0xF44E60285F1ee1df008f39AB9201864444188197/dEmDCc7beN\_Nm0PfXubNs\_1LrGTnmk6iG\_RgLmqYRkE) team behind [Tribute DAO Framework](https://github.com/openlawteam?language=markdown), formerly Open Law _"have deployed nearly ten DAOs (with one or two coming every month) together have over $150m and have supported over 150 projects"_. [Source.](https://mirror.xyz/0xF44E60285F1ee1df008f39AB9201864444188197/dEmDCc7beN\_Nm0PfXubNs\_1LrGTnmk6iG\_RgLmqYRkE) We saw TributeLab's DAO Framework as game changing and sought to expand the universe of adapters and extensions on their platform.
+
+Movement DAO cares deeply in making our UX an engaging and intuitive. Combining each of the above mechanics, protocols in an easy to convey manner is hard. We think hard means it's worth working towards.
+
+Movement DAO added a number of adapters and extensions relating to the management of movements and the treasuries the communities funded.

+## Smart Contract Audit
+
+### Auditors
+
+Mr. T. N. or [@t4sk](https://github.com/t4sk) is currently reviewing the existing repository and contracts and providing the development team with a recommendations report. This work is specifically targeted at the adapters and extensions as they relate to the Unagi Vault, Sushi and UniSwap liquidity deployments and the bonding curve contracts.
+
+Also underway [\`OpenLaw\`](https://tributedao.com) themselves have engaged [SigmaPrime](https://sigmaprime.io) to audit the Tribute contracts. We have contacted SigmaPrime and notified them of our intent to hire them to do the formal audit when we are feature complete. They asked that we do not use their name on our materials until we have signed an agreement with them. We have set aside a budget to bill against when we are closer to feature complete.
+
+### Scope
+
+Movement DAO's core premise is to enabling a community by seeding it with multiple-millions of Ethereum to create any Movement and Actions they deem worthwhile, entrusting the collective wisdom of the community and their appointed leaders to accomplish that which has remained generally opaque to the individual - charity organizations as they operate today.
+
+Movement DAO's core is a collection of smart contracts which govern managing a pool of assets on behalf of Movement and its sub-movements, the Endowment bank. Given each Movement has its own property and funds which are managed by Movement, and adapters and extensions which govern how the funds are collected, distributed, and managed are all areas which require extensive design, analysis, and audit before it is employed on Ethereum Mainnet.

+
+The Movement DAO is governed by its staked token holders. **$MOVE** tokens represent the power to influence change to governance, economics, and incentives in the Movement DAO.
+
+Benefits to **$MOVE** token holders include voting on matters relating to:
+
+* Movement leaders, senators to represent the community
+* Endowment management from operational expenses to DeFi protocols

+## Individual $Movement tokens
+
+Movement token holders are responsible for voting on the leadership of their movements, along with determining economic design and governance aspects of the movements. $(Movement) tokens have their own unique ticker symbols ($BLM, for example).

+## Token Distribution
+
+$MOVE tokens and $(Movement) tokens are distributed using a [bonding curve](../../learning/glossary#bonding-curve), a systematic formula that determines the price at which each incremental token is minted based on total supply. This mechanism makes for a fair and sustainable foundation for building a decentralized community.&#x20;
+
+$MOVE tokens and $(Movement) tokens are distributed via a [bonding curve](https://github.com/themovementdao/move-monorepo/blob/main/packages/contracts/contracts/extensions/bondingcurve/BondingCurve.sol), a systematic formula that determines the price at which each incremental token is minted based on total supply. Details of this mechanism are explained [here](https://medium.com/giveth/deep-dive-augmented-bonding-curves-3f1f7c1fa751) and [here](https://medium.com/thoughtchains/on-bonding-curves-as-funding-mechanisms-a0812b22cc3d), and [here](https://commonsstack.org/abc).
+
+After the initial $MOVE Distribution via contributions to the endowment and via a community Merkle distributor airdrop, the community will manage the remaining treasury through Snapshot.
+
+A break down of the token distribution and allocation can be found [here](../../tokens/get-tokens).
+
+{% hint style="info" %}
+A bonding curve describes **the relationship between the price and supply of an asset**. It is a mathematical concept modeling the idea that the price of an asset (with a limited quantity) increases slightly for subsequent buyers with each purchase.

+
+## Movement DAO Endowment
+
+A number of platforms exist which enabled communities to raise funds, notably, [Juicebox](https://juicebox.money/#/). Movement DAO includes an endowment which it will use the DeFi earned Yield to fund additional tooling for funded projects to deploy liquidity pools (LPs), and navigate more complex blockchain applications and tooling.
+
+The Movement DAO's initial endowment is at the Gnosis Safe \`0x46D65c64E883f70371A6fcAcB124FB5dd68c9918\` is intended to be the catalyst for additional endowment contributions and individuals interesting in forming their own DAOs around a movement subject.
+
+Each of the Gnosis Safe contributors during the Seeding period are provided the $MOVE token.
+
+**Movement DAO Endowment Funding** comes from:
+
+* Gnosis Safe ETH (Œû) or DAI contributions between February 2nd, 2022 2:22:22 and February 22, 2022, 2:22:22.
+* Movement submission tributes to Movement DAO.
+* Tributes associated with any vesting or staking mechanics decided by the community.
+
+**Ongoing Endowment Growth** comes from:
+
+1. Endowment and Treasury management with a DeFi protocol.
+2. Liquidity Pools for $MOVE and ETH Œû, or DAI.
+3. Successfully funded $(Movements).
+4. Providing liquidity in liquidity pools for $MOVE, and $(Movement).
+
+Proceeds of endowment earnings are deployed by the community.

+# üåé Communities
+
+Movement DAO envisions a world where decentralized communities organize & operate with the efficiency of a startup.
+
+## **How DAOs organize on Movement DAO**
+
+Movements include a few key features to help their communities organize.&#x20;
+
+**Leaders**
+
+All movements have discrete leadership positions, define election cycles, define compensation, and then elect those leaders. Movement leaders choose which motions are funded. The first leaders for a movement can either be _hardcoded_, or voted on by the community. Movement leaders are a dynamic feature that can enable many different types of communities to effectively organize.&#x20;
+
+**Actions**&#x20;
+
+All movements include Actions. Actions are a request for capital submitted by an individual, to a movement. This request describes the use of funds, milestones to release capital, official roles, and an ability for the submitter to verify their public identity through twitter integration.&#x20;
+
+Milestones enable a trustless system for deploying capital in stages for a large project.&#x20;
+
+Actions are submitted as a Motion. After a Motion has been approved it becomes a live Action.&#x20;
+
+Motions can include:&#x20;
+
+* Access to a service provider who can convert crypto into USD
+* Discrete roles with their own descriptions, salaries, and durations&#x20;
+* Complex voting mechanisms, such as [conviction voting](https://medium.com/giveth/conviction-voting-a-novel-continuous-decision-making-alternative-to-governance-aa746cfb9475), [quadratic voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic\_voting), [delegate voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegate\_\(American\_politics\)), [whitelist voting](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/whitelist), and others.&#x20;
+
+{% hint style="info" %}
+**Bill Nye Motion Example**
+
+Assume Bill Nye the science guy wanted money to organize free science lessons for the community in Washington Square Park. He could submit an Action which describes multiple key milestones, such as getting started, securing a city permit, paying volunteers, purchasing supplies and finally giving the community lessons.&#x20;
+
+Now assume Bill Nye needs $10,000 to fully complete his Action. And he gets $2,000 upon successful completion of each milestone. Because Bill Nye is only compensated on a milestone basis, if the city were to deny his permit, the movement would have only paid Bill Nye $2,000, instead of the total $10,000. These milestones help to create a trustless system for deploying capital.&#x20;
+
+Milestone completion is verified and voted on by the community.&#x20;
+
+Actions also feature identity verification to reduce fraud. For example, when Bill Nye submits his Action he can prove that he is in fact the real Bill Nye, instead of the nefarious Nill Bye. He proves his identity by linking his twitter account to the movement.&#x20;
+{% endhint %}
+
+{% hint style="warning" %}
+All Actions have a 24 hour veto period before funds are moved. If the community suspects fraud they can flag the Action. Select community members possess veto power over all funds that exit Movement DAO. This process adds an extra layer of security for the Movement DAO community.&#x20;
+{% endhint %}
+
+**Future Innovation**
+
+Movement DAO is built with a modular architecture and is designed to benefit from future innovations to enable community collaboration. For example:
+
+1. Movements can use "Gelato" (in development by Open Law) to enable gasless voting.
+2. Interface improvements. The best interface for a DAO is a challenging problem that will require continuous innovation.&#x20;
+3. Actions can be infinitely deployed. For example, assume a movement wants to create a $1,000 reward for every 1,000 trees that someone plants. It can create this actions once and anyone can claim the reward forever.&#x20;
+
+## Roles
+
+_"How can I get involved?"_
+
+1. **As a movement leader** - Submit a proposal for a new movement or get involved in a new movement community. Movement leaders are often those who are proposing new movements, however communities may find more influential leaders that can grow their communities better over time. Additionally, leaders can choose to have delegates who they allocate a portion of their rewards to increase the scope of the network and its influence.
+2. **As a developer** - Join our Discord and stay active within the Developer channel. We encourage a collaborative developer community to help make the platform the best it can be.
+3. **As a community organizer** - Decentralized communities require community members that take on leadership roles to help organize and mobilize their respective communities to take action and work together. Communities will naturally identify skillful leaders and create incentives to keep them engaged in these important roles.
+
+## Movement DAO Membership
+
+In addition to participating in the community to brainstorm, weed out, and distill the very best $(Movements), $MOVE members are responsible for proposing and voting on the following:
+
+1. How the endowment, long term, and short term funds are allocated,
+2. Scoping out and executing upon the mission and vision of the DAO,
+3. Engage and foster community in both as a steward of the endowment but in the tooling in which the DAO invests its time and energy to enable its members.
+
+Movement DAO membership is required by the communities which use its platform to create $Movements, is given to individuals who are stewarding it mission and goals, and is available to people who choose to help fund its treasury directly during the initial endowment seed or by acquiring its token on the secondary market.
+
+## What is a Movement?
+
+{% hint style="success" %}
+Movements are fundamentally communities with a common purpose or goal formed with capital in order to take actions. The benefit of forming such a community in Movement DAO is to take advantage of the economies of scale and the intrinsic benefit of the financial tooling and capital enabled by its endowment.
+{% endhint %}
+
+While some community coordination may occur prior to the submission of a movement on Movement DAO, we believe [Discord](https://discord.gg/movexyz) and other social media outlets may play significant part in the collaboration between parties to arrive at a consensus to the appropriate initialization parameters. To that end, Movement DAO intends to facilitate environments fertile for engagement.
+
+## What is an Action?
+
+A community project with predefined funding requirements.&#x20;
+
+Actions are the mechanisms for how movements fund & monitor real world projects. Learn more about initiatives in the [communities section]().&#x20;
+
+## How are Movements created?&#x20;
+
+1. Submit a movement on [move.xyz](http://move.xyz/movements/start).
+2. Seed the first 500 DAI (this tribute is non-refundable).&#x20;
+3. Rally community & raise 50,000 DAI. &#x20;
+
+## **How does Movement governance work?**&#x20;
+
+The community token holders and movement leaders govern the project. Because Movement DAO holds a large number of tokens, the Movement DAO collective is able to vote on individual movement initiative.&#x20;
+
+Movement DAO also has veto powers on any movements or initiatives that break the community guidelines.&#x20;

+# ü™ô Token Release
+
+## How it works
+
+The following is the current plan for the token distribution of $MOVE.
+
+### Phase 1. The Seeder's Endowment Contribution
+
+The Movement DAO's Seed will occur **February 2, 2022, 2:20am**, and will total **Œû n and n DAI**.
+
+### Phase 2. Community Seeding of the Endowment
+
+The Community public seeding period opens on **February 2, 2022, 2:22pm.** Contributions to the Gnosis Safe will be recorded via Github repository [Bonding-Curve-Snapshot](https://github.com/tankbottoms/bonding-curve-snapshot).
+
+**February 22, 2022, 2:22pm** - Snapshot of the Gnosis Safe contributions
+
+{% hint style="info" %}
+**Post February 22, 2022,** The following phases will occur when the total token allocation can be properly computed.
+{% endhint %}
+
+### Phase 3. Airdrop to the Community
+
+The Movement DAO team values the cryptocurrency community at large, specific individuals who have contributed to DAO governance, and teams who have worked tirelessly to benefit the community and who's work we have forked, extended, and learned from. Additionally, the DAO sought to be as inclusive as possible and invite as many potential community members into our Discord to contribute to a movement or start one for themselves. The following communities reflect our appreciation.
+
+* the top 1111 individuals who have created or voted on a proposal in a DAO, [source](ipfs://bafkreigz5rq4333o22byqex6lulhss2c66ncurbbcjsfoctmchcykdva3a).
+* the members of [Tribute Lab's DAOs](https://tributelabs.xyz), [source](ipfs://bafkreiawjkbhy24h6ddgp63prxuifetbasvw4xld345ndu3fiiri245cbi).
+* the developers of Tribute Lab's, [source](ipfs://bafkreig26w2fbzhy5wxjpxgn4yr7yqm46wmixnnm4zkpcs6ztjxtbysgcu).
+* any individual who has contributed to the JuiceBox DAO, [source](ipfs://bafybeieqc7iyjoktfw4io44rayl5thbxxqxxczdk7n4yqtmm734shrn2ze).

+* any individual who has transacted with [OpenSea](https://opensea.io), source.
+
+{% hint style="info" %}
+The Seeder's Endowment, Community Seeding, and Airdrop to the Community each are a collection of Ethereum addresses which will be used to generate a Merkle root for the Merkle distributor - enabling the claiming of each of the tokens. Technical details of the Merkle distributor maybe found [here](https://github.com/Uniswap/merkle-distributor). A friendly explanation of an airdrop via Merkle distributor is found [here](https://medium.com/hackernoon/evolution-of-airdrop-from-common-spam-to-the-merkle-tree-30caa2344170).
+{% endhint %}
+
+## How are my total tokens calculated?&#x20;
+
+Tokens will be priced in accordance with a linear bonding curve.&#x20;
+
+It is possible that presale tokens will be subject to partial vesting in order to discourage pump and dump activity. Any vesting will be transparent and voted on by the community in discord beforehand.&#x20;
+
+## How do I receive my purchased tokens?&#x20;
+
+* Go to our claim page&#x20;
+* Just hookup your wallet, pay gas, and press claim!&#x20;
+
+## When do I receive my tokens?&#x20;
+
+February 22nd, 2022
+
+## How do I know the token launch is fair?&#x20;
+
+The community will have 72 hours to audit the token airdrop list before it is released.&#x20;
+
+[Learn more](#how-do-i-know-the-token-launch-is-fair).&#x20;
+
+## Token Allocation&#x20;
+
+Tokens plan to be distributed as follows:&#x20;
+
+![](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F5pXCi1sB4wpjzJuQ5gnE%2Fuploads%2FxHvTcWvWQ5ZV4tz7oazL%2Fsignal-2022-02-02-105823\_001.png?alt=media\&token=4e52a1cc-c881-429c-9e56-306eabb57e2d)
+
+Movement DAO controls the treasury and LP pool tokens.&#x20;
+
+The 10% of tokens dedicated to staking rewards will serve as the rewards for the first \~30 days. After this time the community will vote on how many new tokens to mint to continue rewards.&#x20;
+
+## Rationale <a href="#how-is-the-code-released" id="how-is-the-code-released"></a>
+
+{% hint style="warning" %}
+The above is subject to change depending on the final contribution amount to the Gnosis Safe. The final method and token computation will be shared within the [Movement DAO's Discord](https://discord.gg/GcWZbhuAhb).
+{% endhint %}
+
+The Seeder's endowment is intended to kickstart the Movement DAO. After the Community Seeding phase completes, the Gnosis Safe contributions will be computed on a linear bonding curve in order to compute the token allocation. The tokens computed will determine the total additional tokens in each of the above allocations to be minted.

-# Basics
-
-## $MOVE Governance tokens
-
-The Movement DAO is governed by its token holders. **$MOVE** tokens are the native currency used to create, mint or buy new [movement tokens](#individual-usdmovement-tokens). **$MOVE** tokens also represent the power to influence change to governance, economics, and incentives in the Movement DAO.
-
-Benefits to **$MOVE** token holders:
-
-* Governance vote for projects anywhere in the network&#x20;
-* Governance vote on how to best manage the endowment&#x20;
-* Governance vote on all community based decisions&#x20;
-
-_$MOVE Governance tokens are not to be deemed or interpreted to be representative of any kind of:_
-
-* _Currency, legal tender, money or deposit_
-* _Investment (whether secured or unsecured), equity interest, proprietary interest and economic rights_
-* _Equity, debt or hybrid instrument, security collective investment scheme managed fund, financial derivative, futures contract, deposit, commercial paper, negotiable instrument, investment contract, note, bond, warrant, certificate or instrument entitling the holder to interest, dividends or any kind of return, nor any other financial instrument; or..._
-* _Right, title, interest or benefit whatsoever in whole or in part, in any person or property, or any assets_
-
-_$MOVE Governance tokens are not guaranteed or secured by any person, asset or entity in any way. The team is not under any obligation to issue replacement tokens if they are lost, stolen, destroyed, or otherwise inaccessible for any reason._
-
-## Individual $Movement tokens
-
-Movement token holders are responsible for voting on the leadership of their movements, along with determining economic design and governance aspects of the movements. $(Movement) tokens have their own unique ticker symbols ($BLM, for example). Most importantly, the movement token holder communities collaborate and vote on which leaders to elect. These leaders choose the [actions](broken-reference) they wish to fund.
-
-Benefits to **$(Movement)** token holders
-
-* Governance of the Movement and governance proposals
-* Launch movement actions&#x20;
-* Elect movement leaders&#x20;
-
-_$Movement tokens are not to be deemed or interpreted to be representative of any kind of:_
-
-* _Currency, legal tender, money or deposit_
-* _Investment (whether secured or unsecured), equity interest, proprietary interest and economic rights_
-* _Equity, debt or hybrid instrument, security collective investment scheme managed fund, financial derivative, futures contract, deposit, commercial paper, negotiable instrument, investment contract, note, bond, warrant, certificate or instrument entitling the holder to interest, dividends or any kind of return, nor any other financial instrument; or..._
-* _right, title, interest or benefit whatsoever in whole or in part, in any person or property, or any assets_
-
-_$Movement tokens are not guaranteed or secured by any person, asset or entity in any way. The team is not under any obligation to issue replacement tokens if they are lost, stolen, destroyed, or otherwise inaccessible for any reason._
-
-## Token Distribution
-
-$MOVE tokens and $(Movement) tokens are distributed using a [bonding curve](../../learning/glossary#bonding-curve), a systematic formula that determines the price at which each incremental token is minted based on total supply. This mechanism makes for a fair and sustainable foundation for building a decentralized community.&#x20;
-
-## The Movement DAO Endowment
-
-The traditional endowment uses its principal funding to earn a rate of return used to fund actions within an organization. This process is hindered by a great deal of bureaucratic friction and costly intermediaries in order to operate. The nature of decentralized communities and decentralized finance ([DeFi](../../learning/glossary#defi)) mechanisms allow for a new innovation in continuous funding we call the endowment.
-
-The Movement DAO uses the funding power of the platform to continuously fund its community managed endowment. The endowment pool utilizes DeFi tools to generate yield on the endowment principal. All of the earnings of the Movement DAO go into the $MOVE endowment. The community controls how the assets of the $MOVE endowment are managed to generate returns and decide how to allocate the returns on $MOVE endowment capital. The principal balance of the endowment is designed to stay locked in perpetuity and to provide continuous funding to the Movements it supports.
-
-**Movement DAO Endowment Funding** comes from:
-
-1. Earning an allocation of tokens for each newly minted $(Movement).
-2. Tributes related to network activity such as minting, burning, swapping, proposal submissions, and early liquidation of vested tokens.&#x20;
-
-**Ongoing Endowment Growth** comes from:
-
-1. Yield farming of $MOVE tokens
-2. Swapping activity between $MOVE and $(Movement) tokens
-
-Proceeds of endowment earnings are deployed by the community.&#x20;

### overview/movement-communities.md

-# Movement Communities
-
-Movement DAO envisions a world where decentralized communities organize & operate with the efficiency of a startup.
-
-### **How DAOs organize on Movement DAO**
-
-Movements include a few key features to help their communities organize.&#x20;
-
-**Leaders**
-
-First, all movements have the option to create leadership positions, define election cycles, define compensation, and then elect those leaders. Movement leaders have predefined, fixed, voting power. The first leaders for a movement can either be hardcoded, or voted on by the community. Movement leaders are a dynamic feature that can enable many different types of communities to effectively organize.&#x20;
-
-**Actions**&#x20;
-
-All movements include Actions. Actions are a request for capital submitted by an individual, to a movement. This request describes the use of funds, milestones to release capital, official roles, and an ability for the submitter to verify their public identity through twitter integration.&#x20;
-
-Milestones enable a trustless system for deploying capital in stages for a large proeject. For example, assume Bill Nye the science guy wanted money to organize free science lessons for the community in Washington Square Park. He could submit an Action which describes multiple key milestones, such as getting started, securing a city permit, paying volunteers, purchasing supplies and finally giving the community lessons.&#x20;
-
-Now assume Bill Nye needs $10,000 to fully complete his Action. And he gets $2,000 upon successful completion of each milestone. Because Bill Nye is only compensated on a milestone basis, if the city were to deny his permit, the movement would have only paid Bill Nye $2,000, instead of the total $10,000. These milestones help to create a trustless system for deploying capital.&#x20;
-
-Milestone completion is verified and voted on by the community.&#x20;
-
-Actions also feature identity verification to reduce fraud. For example, when Bill Nye submits his Action he can prove that he is in fact the real Bill Nye, instead of the nefarious Nill Bye. He proves his identity by linking his twitter account to the movement.&#x20;
-
-Actions include access to a service provider who can convert crypto into USD. For example, assume a movement would like to pay an architect to create a DAOG park. The architect might still live in past and tragically not use crypto. Therefore, the movement can convert $DAI to USD through a law firm who acts as a service provider to the platform.&#x20;
-
-Finally, Actions can create discrete roles. For example, an Action to setup a twitter following for a movement could feature a twitter manager who is compensated in tokens on a regular basis.&#x20;
-
-Actions are the only mechanism to remove money from Movement DAO. All Actions have a 24 hour veto period before funds are moved. If the community suspects fraud they can flag the Action. Select community members possess veto power over all funds that exit Movement DAO. This process adds an extra layer of security for the Movement DAO community.&#x20;
-
-Actions can also be packaged with complex voting mechanisms, such as [conviction voting](https://medium.com/giveth/conviction-voting-a-novel-continuous-decision-making-alternative-to-governance-aa746cfb9475), [quadratic voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic\_voting), [delegate voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegate\_\(American\_politics\)), [whitelist voting](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/whitelist), and others.&#x20;
-
-**Future Innovation**
-
-Movement DAO is built with a modular architecture and is designed to benefit from future innovations to enable community collaboration. For example:
-
-1. Movements can use "Gelato" (in development by Open Law) to enable gasless voting. We hope this innovation will help to further democratize DAO access to communities everywhere.&#x20;
-2. Interface improvements. The best interface for a DAO is a challenging problem that will require continuous innovation.&#x20;
-3. Actions can be infinitely deployed. For example, assume a movement wants to create a $1,000 reward for every 1,000 trees that someone plants. It can create this actions once and anyone can claim the reward forever.&#x20;
-
-## What is a movement?
-
-Movements are social communities powered by blockchain, in a unique structure called a [DAO](../../learning/glossary#dao). DOAs allow communities to communicate about shared goals, collaborate, coordinate and effectively fund projects.&#x20;
-
-Movements are an innovative new way to raise capital and coordinate initiatives for the world's most important social and environmental issues.
-
-## What is an action?
-
-A community project with predefined funding requirements. Initiatives are the mechanisms for how movements fund & monitor real world projects. Learn more about initiatives in the [communities section]().&#x20;
-
-## How are movements created?&#x20;
-
-First, before submitting a movement, you should rally support behind your movement. Movements have gas fees and require a 500 DAI tribute to submit (in order to disuade spam). They cannot be changed after submission and only have 30 days to reach their financing goal.&#x20;
-
-After a movement has been proposed backers can support the movement with DAI, $MOVE or ETH. If the movement raises enough funding supporter tokens are converted directly into the native movement token and distributed.&#x20;
-
-## **How does movement governance work?**&#x20;
-
-The community token holders and movement leaders govern the project. Because Movement DAO holds a large number of tokens, the Movement DAO collective is able to vote on individual movement initiative.&#x20;
-
-Movement DAO also has veto powers on any movements or initiatives that break the community guidelines.&#x20;
```

### overview/token-release.md

```diff
-# Token Release
-
-## How does the token launch work?&#x20;
-
-Movement DAO is minting tokens directly from the bonding curve.&#x20;
-
-1. Tokens are released for presale in early January. They are availible for presale until January 30th.&#x20;
-2. Tokens purchased during the presale will be priced according to a linear bonding curve.&#x20;
-3. The exact bonding curve specifications will be voted on in discord.&#x20;
-4. Tokens will be distributed via a Merkal Airdrop.&#x20;
-5. The community will have 72 hours to review the airdrop list before tokens are distributed.&#x20;
-6. Tokens will be distributed on February 2nd at 2:22pm EST.&#x20;
-7. Token purchased in the presale will never expire.&#x20;
-
-## How are my total tokens calculated?&#x20;
-
-Tokens will be priced in accordance with a linear bonding curve.&#x20;
-
-It is possible that presale tokens will be subject to partial vesting in order to discourage pump and dump activity. Any vesting will be transparent and voted on by the community in discord beforehand.&#x20;
-
-## How do I receive my purchased tokens?&#x20;
-
-* Merkal airdrop website&#x20;
-* Just hookup your wallet, pay gas, and press claim!&#x20;
-
-
-
-## When do I receive my tokens?&#x20;
-
-February 2nd, 2:22pm EST, 2022.
-
-## How do I know the token launch is fair?&#x20;
-
-The community will have 72 hours to audit the token airdrop list before it is released.&#x20;
-
-[Learn more](#how-do-i-know-the-token-launch-is-fair).&#x20;
-
-## Token Allocation
-
-Galt seeded Movement DAO with owning 20% of all tokens. Galt answer to no investors, venture capitalists or special interest groups. Galt hope that the market value of these tokens represents a multiple above the original purchase price. These tokens provide Movement DAO with a large capital reserve to fund its ecosystem.&#x20;
-
-Movement DAO commits to:
-
-* Minimum 5% of all tokens go towards movements.
-* Minimum 5% of tokens are to fund product development. &#x20;
-* Minimum 5% of all tokens are to compensate community members.&#x20;
-
-Movements have complete discretion on how to deploy these tokens in persuit of these objectives.&#x20;
-
-![Token Breakdown](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F5pXCi1sB4wpjzJuQ5gnE%2Fuploads%2FFKZm2djc8Z4wFB5mzf7e%2FFrame%20344574.png?alt=media\&token=cf9cfb05-6a08-49ee-bae4-b21e297b5709)
-
-An important note, the locked LP tokens are owned by John Galt in reward for developing the system.&#x20;
-
-Finally, token distribution and funding amounts are subject to change at the communities discretion.&#x20;
-
-## How is the code released?&#x20;
-
-The codebase is released in three stages in order to optimize security, usability and decentralization (in that order).&#x20;
-
-**Stage One, Code Public for Audit (Presale release - 02/02/2022)**
-
-Code status:&#x20;
-
-* Backend code is released [open source](../../for-developers/repositories)&#x20;
-* Frontend code lives on IPFS&#x20;
-* Contracts live on [test-net](../../for-developers/smart-contracts#rinkeby) for developers&#x20;
-* Contracts live on [Main-net](../../for-developers/smart-contracts)&#x20;
-* Minor reliance on select server functions&#x20;
-
-**Stage Two, All Systems Live (02/02/2022 - TBD)**&#x20;
-
-Code status:&#x20;
-
-* Staking contracts added &#x20;
-* Code updated per [security audit](../../for-developers/security-audits) work&#x20;
-* All server functionality moved to smart contracts&#x20;
-* Minor reliance on select centralized databases (Github Gist's)&#x20;
-
-**Stage Three, 100% Decentralized (TBD - forever)**
-

 ## Unleashing our collective potential

-Solving societal problems is an age-old challenge with few solutions. To date, there have been two we've relied on: government and nonprofits. Both require immense amount of capital to support their legacy infrastructure and bureaucratic processes void of accountability. The more dollars spent, the more inefficient, ineffective, and corrupt they become. The people, who's hard-earned dollars have been siphoned into these black holes, are only left with broken promises. The result: with every $1 contributed, $0.99 goes to the void, and $0.01 goes to impact.

 ## Our three key beliefs

 We believe the world already has:
 The Movement DAO is made up of two token systems.

 1. The **$MOVE token** governs the platform. These token holders are responsible for growing the endowment and deploying capital into movements.
-2. **$(Movement) tokens** govern individual movements. These token holders are responsible for funding & supporting their communities' projects. Movements have their own symbol (ie. $BLM).&#x20;
-
-_These tokens will be used to provide authentication into community chat rooms (Discord), voting activities (Snapshot), and participation in the movement. However the token does not entitle the holder to the expectation of any profits from a movement nor is there a guarantee that the tokens will increase in value over time. The purchase of the governance token is simply the threshold that allows the purchaser to participate in the governance of the movement endowment that allows the purchaser a voice in the movements that the DAO should support_

 ## Unleashing our collective potential

-Solving societal problems is an age-old challenge with few solutions. To date, we've relied on two: government and nonprofits. Both require immense amounts of capital to support legacy infrastructure and bureaucratic processes void of accountability. The more dollars spent, the more inefficient, ineffective, and corrupt they become. The people, who's hard-earned dollars have been siphoned into these black holes, are only left with broken promises. The result: with every $1 contributed, $0.99 goes to the void, and $0.01 goes to impact.

+
+{% hint style="info" %}
+**Wallet Connect Bug**
+
+When a wallet is connected via Wallet Connect and has a DAI transaction that transaction may appear denominated in ETH.&#x20;
+
+For example, assume you want to purchase 1000 DAI worth of $MOVE. The transaction in your wallet will confirm if you're ready to transfer 1000 ETH, otherwise 3.0 million worth of ETH. This transaction will be approved, because Wallet Connect is still processing it as a DAI transaction.&#x20;

+
+# Service Provider
+
+DAOs are currently not universally recognized as legal entities. Therefore in addition to overseeing the assets of the DAO and how they are distributed by being one of the signers for the Gnosis Safe - [dao-lawfirm.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0x752515a3a1091b9f1c04416cf79d1f14d2340085), the DAO through its members are responsible for the costs associated with its activities. This includes reviewing statements made in this GitBook, what the tokens maybe used for and what [Legal Disclaimers ](../token-sale-and-use)and [Terms of Use](../terms-of-use) are acceptable given the current laws.&#x20;
+
+### Fees and Expenses
+
+Movement DAO developer contemplated the use of a service provider to help facilitate, for example, paying other service providers who may not be strictly anonymous or accepting of Ethereum. Currently an anonymous donor is paying for the fees associated with the service provider until the DAO governance if formed and snapshot votes render the will of its members.
+
+Following other DAOs, with different charters, such as [Flamingo DAO](https://docs.flamingodao.xyz/), and the fees associated with their activities, we estimate spending 2% of the assets held per year on such legal services.
+
+Upon the formation of the governance for Movement DAO, this will be submitted for the community vote via [snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/movedao.eth).

 #### &#x20;Today, a [Movement](http://move.xyz) begins.

-## Mission
+## Vision: Unleash our collective potential

-Movement DAO empowers individuals and communities to confidently form blockchain based programmable treasuries from inception to ongoing operations. Movement DAO is enabled by a seed endowment which is farmed through Defi and distributed to the DAO for operations, development, and further distribution to its community of DAOs.
+MOVE beliefs that we already have the passion, intelligence, and resources to solve the world's greatest problems. What's missing is the right incentive design.&#x20;

-## Its starts with a movement
+**MOVE is an experimental platform to promote social, public good and environemntal change.**

-A movement is a DAO community, organized around a shared mission, that lives on Movement DAO.
+Solving societal problems is an age-old challenge with few solutions. These solutions are built upon legacy infrastructure and bureaucratic processes. The more dollars spent, the more inefficient, ineffective, and corrupt our systems become. The people, who's hard-earned dollars have been siphoned into these black holes, are only left with broken promises. The result: with every $1 contributed, $0.90 goes to the void, and $0.10 goes to impact.

-Movements can support **social, community, art, green, and public goods** causes amongst many others. The only limitation is our own imagination.
+MOVE introduces a radical new approach to collective problem solving. We hope that MOVE makes our imagination the only limitation to societal change.
+
+## How it Works
+
+Web 2.0 movements live on Twitter, Facebook and GoFundMe. Web 3.0 Movements will live on DAOs.
+
+Web 3.0 Movements are owned by their token holders. They have trustless funding that aligns incentives. And their leaders are held accountable by the community.
+
+MOVE is building a better way for Movements to organize. The platform is currently under development and conducting a token presale to fund its endowment.

 Learn more about the [vision for movements](../community/vision#movement-ideas) on Movement DAO.

-## Official links
+## MOVE Token System&#x20;
+
+1. The **$MOVE token** governs the platform. These token holders are responsible for growing the endowment and deploying capital into movements.
+2. **$(Movement) tokens** govern individual movements. These token holders are responsible for funding & supporting their communities' projects. Movements have their own token (ie. $BLM).

Movement DAO focuses on what is difficult for communities to manage - investing and managing their treasuries with vaults, liquidity pools while not to interfere with price discovery.
