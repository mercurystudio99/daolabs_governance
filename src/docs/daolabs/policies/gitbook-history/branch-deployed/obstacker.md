 1. When transferring tokens from the bonding curve wallet into the movement vault, the community has the right to veto the destination address. Therefore, community funds cannot be moved without community approval.&#x20;
 2. A registered law firm acts as a signatory on the funds wallet. They **therefore owe a fiduciary duty to the movement and will employ their expertise to ensure that no funds are moved in violation of the movement rules and no requests for funding would be indicative of fraudulent activity.** &#x20;

-Movement DAO's core premise is to enabling a community by seeding it with multiple-millions of Ethereum to create any Movement and Actions they deem worthwhile, entrusting the collective wisdom of the community and their appointed leaders to accomplish that which has remained generally opaque to the individual - charity organizations as they operate today.Movement DAO's core is a collection of smart contracts which govern managing a pool of assets on behalf of Movement and its sub-movements, the Endowment bank. Given each Movement has its own property and funds which are managed by Movement, and adapters and extensions which govern how the funds are collected, distributed, and managed are all areas which require extensive design, analysis, and audit before it is employed on Ethereum Mainnet.

 Solving societal problems is an age-old challenge with few solutions. These solutions are built upon legacy infrastructure and bureaucratic processes. The more dollars spent, the more inefficient, ineffective, and corrupt our systems become. The people, who's hard-earned dollars have been siphoned into these black holes, are only left with broken promises. The result: with every $1 contributed, $0.90 goes to the void, and $0.10 goes to impact.
