 At Movement DAO, our collective success relies on our ability to work together in harmony. We ask that all community members adhere to our eightfold pledge for building and maintaining communities in the right way.

 1. **Right view** â€“ Right view means that community members are aligned in their values and goals for global impact. Each community will become the product of our collective spirit, optimism and hard work in developing sustainable communities for positive impact.
-2. **Right intention** â€“ This platform is designed for real world impact. While other blockchain projects are designed for boosting economic status, we are here to turn this economic potential into changing the world. While the potential for comping EARNING is substantial, community members should consider this platform as a means to compound GIVING.

 3. **Right speech** â€“ Unlike social media platforms that are plagued with divisiveness and inflammatory discourse, this platform is designed for people to mobilize, collaborate and make impact together. We have no time to waste with distractions like divisive speech, abuse, or unrelated chatter.
 4. **Right action** â€“ Community members should be fully aligned with their intentions in both the physical world and the digital world. Community members should not use this platform to influence or manipulate the real world in a malignant way. Everyone should feel safe to express their opinions and contributions free from any malicious reaction. The community should engage in non-violent communication and conflict resolution. The community must build and maintain a level of trust by quickly highlighting any instances of fraudulent or malicious activity.
 5. **Right livelihood** â€“ It is possible for community members to grow their earn and make impact. There are several other platforms for those seeking lambos. We ask that community members don't let their earning potential detract from their giving potential.

 # ðŸ›£ Roadmap

-Existing website and ETH/DAI contribution to the Movement endowment were intentionally implemented with a Firebase backend in order to minimize onboarding expenses of potential Movements.  This is due to the timing of the Tribute Labs DAO Framework SDK audit and additional features we required to bootstrap the community. Our decision to launch was based on proving the community to participate in the governance of the endowment and governance of $(Movement) definition.&#x20;

 The Movement DAO is composed of the following core activities:
 The Movement DAO is composed of the following core activities:
 * DAO Governance
 * DAO Tokenomics

-### &#x20;Endowment maintenance
+### Endowment maintenance

 While sophisticated vaults do exist to execute investment strategies, Movement DAO seeks to reduce the management, overhead and governance of yield maintenance to a set of long, medium, short positions which produce predictable yields which can be liquidated and deployed to Movement sub-DAOs.

 ### Community Facilitation

-Movement DAO will both define the hierarchy of communities by size, leadership, senators and the types of proposals (adapters) they are responsible for. Additionally, development of collaborative proposal creation, and community interaction through Discord both in reporting on chain activities, to full proposal creation, Snapshot voting and community rewards such as Coordinape are areas of development which will receive investment. &#x20;

-Through Movement DAO's work with extending [Tribute DAO](github-repositories.md), further Open Source collaboration will be invested in, such as participating in the [JukeBox Protocol](https://juicebox.notion.site/Protocol-Workspace-216f62cebc4847bdb2f0742e7b4f2017) and contributing to Ecosystem[ activities](https://juicebox.notion.site/7508d91f38ef4901b5e175ed95b42bf4?v=a66908ffb068469881d4fc13e878a1cc). Examples potentially include [JB-NFT marketplace](https://juicebox.notion.site/Juicebox-Ecosystem-Workspace-7b945ecfd3df409ca47e08595322f27f), and the [Mechanism](https://juicebox.notion.site/Mechanism-Workspace-ea1e928a617e46339cf925f6ccfedfd9). The later having the highest priority as Movement DAO distributes it token.

The latter having the highest priority as Movement DAO distributes it token.

-Movement DAO will continue to work to update the Tribute DAO framework and contribute to funding bounties as well as a "Developer DAO" with Tribute Labs in order to provide opportunities to individuals seeking to be compensated for development efforts.  These efforts will be prioritized by the community and manage as part of a multi-signature wallet upon a pre-determined acceptance criteria.&#x20;

 ### DAO Governance

-By contributing to the Open Source community in general and Tribute Labs in particular the goal would be to define a range of features which satisfies DAO building blocks from small infrequent minimal treasury and transactions, to $10 plus million DAO with dozens of individuals with diverse skill set, which benefit from role-adapter-proposal configuration, and "decentralized" coordination tools.  Including [enabling gas-less transactions](https://github.com/openlawteam/tribute-contracts/tree/master/contracts/companion) and enhancing privacy, to this end a closer coordinated Movement team makes sense to work in tandem with Tribute Labs, or through the Development DAO.

 ### DAO Tokenomics

-The Movement DAO have developed a number of functional repositories which addresses specific tasks as it relates to the workflow of creating a utility token to enabling the token to be exchanged broadly in a market place. Conversely, Movement DAO created an [adapter which allowed the DAO to generate sub-DAOs](https://github.com/themovementdao/move-monorepo/blob/main/packages/contracts/contracts/adapters/MovementAdapter.sol).  Additionally, Movement DAO's financial relationship with its Movement intends to more complex than Jukebox-Protocol's relationship with its platform participants.  A number of platform mechanics are reliant on the working order of the DAO and its stability with regards to its endowment and the operation and involvement of the community in its protocol. Focused effort is a priority while Movement introduces its [token and the mechanics for a stable price discovery](https://juicebox.notion.site/Mechanism-Workspace-ea1e928a617e46339cf925f6ccfedfd9) to emerge. Potential partnership with Jukebox-Protocol or continuing with the forked version are both paths which Movement DAO is pursing.

An endowment is a donation of money or property to a [nonprofit organization](ht

 A number of platforms exist which enabled communities to raise funds, notably, [Juicebox](https://juicebox.money/#/).
