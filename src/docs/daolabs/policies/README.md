## About Us

DAOLABS is building a powerful suite of tools for web3 communities: flexible enough to operate at any scale, with powerful token issuance, treasury management, fiat compatibility, governance, and legal compliance out of the box.

We also build tools like this website and manage governance and operations for our partners, including [Movement DAO](https://move.xyz/), [The Peace Movement DAO](https://peace.move.xyz), and [service-provider.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0x752515a3A1091b9f1c04416CF79D1F14d2340085).
