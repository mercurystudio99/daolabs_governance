## Be careful. This is tankbottoms.eth.

![tankbottoms.eth](https://i.seadn.io/gcs/files/0f65451e0e09e0f2e08c69aacbeb2e93.jpg?auto=format&w=1000)

[Recent events](https://move.xyz/daolabs/daos/move/meeting/20230131.md) have motivated certain [anonymous](mailto:noreply@anonymousemail.me) individuals to send emails to contributors doxing me, tankbottoms.eth. While I have a common name, ranging from a member of the royal family, a methamphetamine dealer currently incarcerated, a few prominent attorneys, and many many more as evidenced by my gmail account, individual(s) feel its necessary to dox me to reveal that I have been to jail, and not in the [metaphorical](https://celmates.wtf/) stake my [pfps](https://opensea.io/tankbottoms_eth) way, despite my palms sweating with anticipation, but in the "don't drop the soap" way.

Additionally, certain anonymous individuals would like everyone to "**backup any messages or other communication with "Tank" Discord messages, GitHub, etc https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter"**. For reference, my GitHub handle is **tankbottoms** and Discord handle is **tankbottoms(üéΩ,üçë)#2749**.

This is my response.

The salacious details are as follows. Since leaving college, as a developer, each project amassed significant resources and attention. I wish I was better equipped to handle what happened when I was younger. I was out maneuvered by a cabal of sophisticated corporate take-over con-artists and their transitioned securities attorney kingpin who perfected employing OTC:BB corporations to orchestrate and conceal a decade long racketeering scheme to launder money, sell unregistered securities, and loot corporations. My credibility got in their way. I subsequently learned the hard way about all types of litigation.

Upon my subsequent release, spent the next decade plus retired popping opiates. In an effort to give a fuck, I traveled to Hong Kong and Shenzhen to work on an Ethereum fork. A few years ago, randomly, shockingly, and completely without application, I was recruited to work at the SEC Cryptocurrency Enforcement division as the lead developer. While my hooch experience was not a factor in my hiring, it was a highlight in my security clearance application, along with my drug history, which were not required for my disclosure, but was provided, if anything, for transparency. Spoiler alert, I was hired and paid a lot of money.

While I am not allowed to discuss the particulars on what I worked on at the Enforcement Division, I did apply for and received the [description of the activities](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/QmdsGenLkSxqU34FTbuXSnTwbNimJKGM9LEcUG4WaoiBYD) - given there were efforts to have various sub-components subcontracted, Exhibit A for usefulness of [FOIA requests](https://www.foia.gov/). Yay government! Subsequently, I was recruited to work as the core Movement developer and contributor by three founders who chose to remain fully anonymous.

What is cool about Web3 is that you are judged by your transactions, code deployments, GitHub, and smart contract interactions.

The purpose of this explanation is to provide context for the following: Movement, or DAOLABS, or the collective core contributor team's complete effort to create transparent accountable entity treasuries operated by removing as much trust as possible between the parties and encode them into the smart contracts and governance, so that we can enable fairer and safer coordination while removing those who would use these tools to manipulate the law or legal structures to achieve their own ends. I have first hand experience from both sides of the table on how fairness has nothing to do with anything, I would like to see this change. Such doxing immediately after the aforementioned member termination actions are neither surprising nor unexpected.

Ps. I will be publishing my Discord messages, GitHub, and other communications in the near future, should totally make for a riveting read.
