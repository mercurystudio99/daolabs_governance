## Individuals

The Association relies on its members to participate in the governance, attestation, and ultimate adjudication of its members. Members participate by reviewing and voting on the Association's governance proposals, reviewing and voting on a member's compliance and attestation of facts which are relevant to the Association's governance.

Members may also participate in the Association's efforts to provide consumer services in setting up legal entities, onchain governance, forum, or other Web3 activities. For example, a member may be asked to support an association of non-members who seek to create a Juicebox project to raise funds for a non-profit purpose.

## DAOs

Projects or associations may also seek membership status in the Association by providing an membership application with at least two members of its Gnosis multi-signature's individual applications. Approved members and current status on any Association dues entitle the member to display the Association's score, badge and mark on its project page and other public facing materials.
