## Introduction

The DAOLABS Association is a membership association that provides consumer assurances that Web3 projects, smart contracts, protocols, or community members are credible. Too many individuals and organizations have been scammed, defrauded, or otherwise harmed by bad actors in the Web3 space.

The Association seeks to model itself after the American Bar Association (ABA) which is a voluntary association of lawyers and law students. The ABA provides a number of services to its members including license to practice law, continuing legal education, referral services, and dispute resolutions with non-lawyers. The ABA also in certain cases maintains a legal fund to assist non-lawyers who have been harmed by the actions of lawyers, or provide legal services to parties who cannot afford a lawyer.

The ABA also removes lawyers from the practice of law when they are found to have engaged in unethical or illegal conduct. In this manner, the ABA is a self-governing body that seeks to protect the public from unethical or illegal conduct by lawyers. The same association framework is needed in the crypto space; and while bad actors are not necessarily smart contract programmers, artists or other Web3 creators, a self-governing body is needed to start somewhere.

The DAOLABS Association, and the legal resources provided on this website, sought to provide clarity to individuals seeking to understand the legal and regulatory landscape of the Web3 space.

:::warning
The Association is in its infancy and formation stage and is not yet a legal entity, however, the Association framework is being developed and will be launched when the time is right. This legal resource tool was developed to provide a free information for individuals, to augment the legal offering, DAOLABS sought to recruit or establish a partnership with a law firm so that individuals who required custom legal, attorney client privilege or registered agent - business filing or other like services would readily available.

The Association will operate as a membership association which provides branding on Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs) and other Web3 projects which represent the project's disclosure of certain information. The Association with service-provider.eth will provide a framework for the disclosure of information and a process for complaints, disputes and resolutions between members and non-members.

DAOLABS seeks to create a protocol to provide consumers assurances that the contracts, projects, and protocols users interact with are legitimate, and the people behind them are trustworthy; even if those people are anonymous.

## Branding and Disclosure

The general public has been victim to repeated scams and frauds in the Web3 space, and absent of a government regulator, the Association will provide a reasonable, realistic, and common sense approach to providing consumer assurances. These assurances will be provided by a score and badge system which will be displayed on the project details page hosted by the Association.

Project members, individual contributors, and other members of the Web3 ecosystem will be able to apply for membership in the Association. The Association will public a membership roster and a summary of the member's transactions. The Association's score and badge will be based on the member's disclosure of certain information and the Association's review of the member's transactions.

The Association will keep a member's information confidential, under attorney client privilege and will not disclose any information to third parties without the member's consent, members agree to participate in any investigation or legal proceeding initiated by the Association, and a threshold of complaints.

### Dues

Members need not pay dues to the Association, however, members may opt to pay dues as the Association will be self-funded until the Association tax-exempt status is approved by the IRS. Members may contribute to the Association's operation and assessment of members by participating in smart contract audits, code reviews and other Association governance activities.

### Enforcement

The Association may participate in litigation against members or non-members who have engaged in illegal or unethical conduct which has harmed the greater Web3 ecosystem. Any funds collected from such litigation will be used to ensure some compensation for victims of the illegal or unethical conduct.
