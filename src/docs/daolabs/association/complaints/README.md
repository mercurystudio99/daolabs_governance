## Introduction

DAOLABS is seeding a membership association to provide consumer assurances that Web3 projects, smart contracts, protocols, or community members are free from complaints. Too many individuals and organizations have been scammed, defrauded, or otherwise harmed by bad actors in the Web3 space. DAOLABS invites credible, evidence based reporting of any activities that may be harmful to the Web3 ecosystem.

:::warning
DAOLABS or the final membership association are not law-enforcement, backed by law-enforcement or otherwise have any criminal legal authority. However, we will work with law-enforcement to the extent possible to help protect the Web3 ecosystem.

The Association will operate a complaint intake form and database similar to that of the Better Business Bureau, the American Bar Association, and other similar organizations which provide the public with a means to report on the activities of members or non-members. The Association will review the complaint and determine if the complaint is credible, and if so, the type of investigation or legal proceedings is appropriate, and any additional subsequent action as determined by the By Laws of the Association and its members.

### Attestation

The Association where possible seeks to preserve the identity of its members including the dissemination of information outside what is obtainable publicly. However, members may choose to attest to their identity and provide additional information which would be reflected in the member's score and badge.

### Adjudication

Prior to any complaint intake process, the Association intends to fully document and propose an impartial and Web3 native adjudication process.
