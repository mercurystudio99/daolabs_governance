Prior to purchasing Tokens, you should carefully consider these Terms and, to the extent necessary, consult a lawyer, accountant, and/or tax professional, as applicable.

Purchases of Tokens should be undertaken only by individuals or companies that have significant experience with, and understanding of, the usage and intricacies of cryptographic tokens, including Ethereum-based tokens and blockchain-based software systems. Purchasers should have an expert understanding of the storage and transmission mechanisms associated with cryptographic tokens. While the Platform will be available to assist the Purchaser of Tokens during the Token Sale via instructions or an application, the Platform will not be responsible in any way for loss of any cryptocurrency, including Tokens, resulting from actions taken by, or omitted by Purchaser. If you do not have such experience or expertise, then you should not purchase Tokens or participate in the Token Sale. Your participation in the Token Sale is deemed to be your understanding and acknowledgment that you satisfy the requirements mentioned in this paragraph.

As further described herein, by purchasing Tokens, and to the extent permitted by law, you agree to not hold the Platform or its respective past, present, and future employees, officers, directors, contractors, consultants, equity holders, suppliers, vendors, service providers, parent companies, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, representatives, predecessors, successors and/or designees liable for any losses or any special, incidental, or consequential damages arising from, or in any way connected, to the sale of Tokens, including losses associated with these Terms.

You are subject to and bound by these Terms by virtue of purchasing the Tokens.

The Tokens have no rights, intended uses or attributes outside of use with the Platform or as otherwise expressly referred to in these Terms.

1.  A purchase of Tokens is non-refundable and cannot be cancelled.

3.  The Platform reserves the right to refuse or cancel Token purchase requests at any time in its sole and absolute discretion.
