## Thesis

Ratify and adopt the [Peace DAO Governance Process](https://gov.move.xyz/peace/governance/process) and the [Peace DAO Multisig Process](https://gov.move.xyz/peace/governance/Multisig).

## Motivation

Currently, Peace DAO does not utilize its [Peace Token](https://juicebox.money/p/peace) or its [Peace DAO Movement NFT](https://etherscan.io/token/0x1c43e7fb2885d9ff4403521eae41d7943f7f51ee) for voting.

Establishing a clear governance process will provide utility to the Token and the NFT, and will more accurately represent the will of donors and contributors.

## Specification

Ratify and adopt the [Peace DAO Governance Process](https://gov.move.xyz/peace/governance/process) and the [Peace DAO Multisig Process](https://gov.move.xyz/peace/governance/Multisig) _([IPFS Mirror](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmNTShzDjbTy73G1a49D61ekhsAFnM1SFkBDaj3SC7LqLo))_.

Update Peace DAO's [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/peace.movedao.eth), [Discord server](https://discord.gg/movexyz), and other relevant resources to reflect these changes.

## Rationale

The Governance Process:

- is simple, reducing ambiguity, loopholes, and confusion. This encourages participation.
- takes place in public. It is transparent and promotes accountability.
- leaves complexity to individual proposals, allowing the DAO to be adaptable. The process can be amended to meet the DAO's needs over time.

The Multisig Process:

- is also simple and easy to understand, leading to similar benefits.
- has safety mechanisms in place (the dao-lawfirm.eth removal) but does not overly centralize execution. New Members must be added through standard governance processes.

## Risks

- These processes rely on sound distribution of tokens and NFTs, as well as sound Multisig Membership.
- Poor decision making, malicious behaviour, or bias from the Multisig could prove disastrous. Multisig Membership should expand over time.
- This government process is more rigid than the DAO's current processes. Although this will improve transparancy, it may make the DAO less flexible in urgent situations.
- The process has high thresholds, meaning only well-liked proposals will pass.
- The process inherits risks of democracy.

## Timeline

These processes should be implemented once this proposal passes a 4-day basic single-choice [Snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/movedao.eth), only to be removed when superseded or amended by another proposal.
