# Process

Peace DAO is governed by its community, as expressed through [Peace Token](https://juicebox.money/p/peace) and [Peace DAO Movement NFT](https://etherscan.io/token/0x1c43e7fb2885d9ff4403521eae41d7943f7f51ee) voting.

## Step 0 - Discussion

Authors can submit proposals at any time by creating a discussion thread in the `#✍️｜proposals` channel of the [Peace DAO Discord](https://discord.gg/movexyz).

:::tip
You can use the [proposal template](template) as a starting point. When writing your proposal, try to be as detailed as possible in your specification. Only include what is necessary—short, specific proposals are best.

## Step 1 - Temperature Check

Once a proposal is finalized, the author can create a **3 day temperature check** (react-vote Discord poll). During the temperature check, authors can update or redact their proposals based on the DAO's feedback.

## Step 2 - Snapshot Voting

A **4 day Snapshot vote** will be created for proposals which receive at least 6 affirmative temperature check votes. Each Snapshot proposal must include the full proposal text or a link to an immutable version of the full proposal text. Proposals must be announced in the DAO's Discord before voting opens.

[Peace DAO's Snapshot Space](https://snapshot.org/#/peace.movedao.eth) will grant 1 vote per [Peace Token](https://juicebox.money/p/peace) and 200,000 votes per [Peace DAO Movement NFT](https://etherscan.io/token/0x1c43e7fb2885d9ff4403521eae41d7943f7f51ee).

## Step 3 - Execution

The DAO's [Multisig](multisig) executes proposals with at least 60% approval on Snapshot.
