# 'Intellectual Property'

PeaceDAO NFT contains artwork created by Natasha Pankina, Illustrator and Designer ("Illustrator"). The design, artwork, and animations were designed for PeaceDAO and ownership of the membership NFT does not grant ownership of anything beyond the NFT, such as the intellectual property or copyright of the underlying artwork. Thus the following terms apply to membership NFTs with artwork which seeks to be retained.
