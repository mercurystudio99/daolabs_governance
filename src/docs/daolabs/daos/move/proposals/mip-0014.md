This proposal seeks Movement Member's ratification of a recent action of the Authorized Members, benreed.eth and tankbottoms.eth, which was cycling all of the keys of the [Gnosis Multi-sig 0x143cC0A996De329C1C5723Ee4F15D2a40c1203c6](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0x143cC0A996De329C1C5723Ee4F15D2a40c1203c6/) due to security concerns.

## Thesis

In response to the recent security issues and threats made against the DAO's treasury's Gnosis signing keys, the Authorized Members met and agreed to cycle all the Gnosis keys. The treasury's Gnosis [multi-sig Gnosis 0x143cC0A996De329C1C5723Ee4F15D2a40c1203c6](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0x143cC0A996De329C1C5723Ee4F15D2a40c1203c6/) will immediately be replaced with the following keys.

## Motivation

The Gnosis holds a significant amount of treasury assets entrusted to the DAO and its community in furtherance of its vision. In addition to unforeseen security concerns such as lost seed phrases, other OpSec breaches, social engineering or unforeseen motivations by one or more of the signers who are not adhering in good faith or whose interests are orthogonal to the DAO, the Gnosis signers shall be cycled from the original founders and Service Provider to certain Members as determined by the Authorized Members.

Additionally, as a reminder, all Gnosis Multi-Signature signers are expected to act in accordance with the DAO Governance [Multi-Signature](https://move.xyz/daolabs/daos/move/governance/multisig.md) sub-section.

## Specification

1. Removing the following Signer(s):

- [eth:0x550bD0F03580B9a687931af4d837F8e45D61d410](https://etherscan.io/address/0x550bD0F03580B9a687931af4d837F8e45D61d410);
- [eth:0x746cf650d4E5431474E8D4E2d5B6Bbe53772b498](https://etherscan.io/address/0x746cf650d4E5431474E8D4E2d5B6Bbe53772b498); and
- [eth:0xDbE76F6ae97dFD5bdd1D7DAD8972740d18aB2b57](https://etherscan.io/address/0xDbE76F6ae97dFD5bdd1D7DAD8972740d18aB2b57);

2. Addition of the above listed Signer(s).

## Rationale

- Authorized Members, benreed.eth and tankbottoms.eth, discussed security concerns and agreed that threats to the DAO and community were imminent;
- Current Service Provider, dao-lawfirm.eth, has resigned;
- The Authorized Members convened, reviewed the pertinent facts, and resolved in authorizing this action;
- Given the current crypto-market sentiment, practicing exceptional security precaution is expected and warranted;
- Multi-Signature signer(s) should be comfortable with cryptographic transactions;

## Risks

- Authorized Members may have been compromised;
- The aforementioned individuals may not have the DAO's best interest in mind;
- The new replacement signers may not be trustworthy.
