This [Emergency Proposal](https://gov.move.xyz/dao/governance/process) has been created to affirm [DAO Multisig](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0x143cC0A996De329C1C5723Ee4F15D2a40c1203c6/) Signer support of the changes proposed below. **By voting affirmatively, Signers are explicitly approving the proposed changes.**

## Thesis

Temporarily transfer all ETH held at [Gnosis 0x143cC0A996De329C1C5723Ee4F15D2a40c1203c6](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0x143cC0A996De329C1C5723Ee4F15D2a40c1203c6/) to a wallet operated by the DAO's Service Provider, dao-lawfirm.eth, to prepare for the Ethereum Merge.

## Motivation

[The Ethereum Merge](https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/) is expected to occur between September 13 and 15. Despite widespread support for the migration to Proof of Stake, certain [groups](https://twitter.com/Poloniex/status/1555085757450272768?s=20) and [individuals](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/08/15/miner-chandler-guo-repeats-support-for-ethereum-fork-post-merge/) favor Proof of Work, and plan to maintain the "original" blockchain. If any such efforts are successful, funds will be "duplicated" across both blockchains, giving the DAO the opportunity to sell its ETH on the Proof of Work blockchain and migrate those funds to the Proof of Stake blockchain, adding to its treasury.

The DAO currently holds funds in the Gnosis Safe referenced above, which (i) may not be operable on post-merge Proof of Work blockchains, and (ii) will significantly slow down selling efforts, either limiting or completely removing the DAO's opportunity for gain.

## Specification

1. As soon as possible, transfer all ETH from the Multisig to:
   1. [0xB500cdA34Ea0313bF2EF626a7Be385f4A910cc79](https://etherscan.io/address/0xB500cdA34Ea0313bF2EF626a7Be385f4A910cc79).
2. Upon completion of the Ethereum Merge, dao-lawfirm.eth shall transfer all ETH back to the original DAO Multisig on the Proof of Stake chain (the canonical post-merge Ethereum blockchain).
3. dao-lawfirm.eth shall attempt to sell the "duplicated" funds on one or more outstanding Proof of Work blockchains.
4. dao-lawfirm.eth shall transfer the proceeds, if converted to post merge ETH or DAI to the original DAO Multisig (less fees and costs associated with this process).

## Rationale

- dao-lawfirm.eth and tankbottoms.eth discussed the idea with both filipv.eth and jimmyethworld.eth and reached consensus that this was of nominal risk.
- dao-lawfirm.eth and tankbottoms.eth have performed similar activities with other custodial wallets without incident.
- dao-lawfirm.eth's representative tankbottoms.eth is a trusted DAO member with duties towards the DAO and no incentive to misappropriate funds.
- Funds will be held within a hardware wallet, reducing the risk of a private key being leaked or otherwise exposed.
- The cost of this specification is relatively minorâ€”just gas.

## Risks

- dao-lawfirm.eth, or tankbottoms.eth could be untrustworthy.
- The aforementioned hardware wallet may be compromised.
- The aforementioned entity or individuals may make some mistake during the transfer or conversion process resulting in lost funds.
