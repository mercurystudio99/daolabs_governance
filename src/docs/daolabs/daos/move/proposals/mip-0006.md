## Thesis

Appoint a treasury committee to provide the community with monthly recommendations to leverage the DAO's endowment. This should instill confidence in the long-term success of the DAO's endowment, by which the DAO will stimulate growth of its ecosystem.

## Motivation

The DAO has not taken advantage of intensive treasury management yet. By leveraging non-controversial investment and diversification strategies, the DAO can expand its runway while minimizing risks.

## Specification

The initial treasury committee Members shall be:

|        ENS        |                                                       ETH Address                                                       |

## Rationale

Designating treasury management recommendations to a small group allows for focused, tightly-scoped discussion. It will also allow these individuals to utilize and to continue building their domain-specific expertise.

## Risks

- As the DAO's assets are diversified, the DAO will inherit risks associated with new assets.
- The DAO may lose out on potential upside to ETH, DAI, or other assets it already holds.
- The treasury committee might make bad recommendations.
- Treasury management may distract from other focuses of the DAO.

## Timeline

The initial treasury committee should provide recommendations within ~30 days of this proposal's ratification.
