## Thesis

Transfer `1,750,000 DAI` from the DAO Multisig[^1] to the Developer Multisig[^2] to bootstrap product development, funding 4 months of product development and minimal operations including:

- product development and development expenses;
- tooling, documentation, and operational structures;
- recruiting costs for a product program manager and meatspace entity management;
- legal and accounting services;
- community-building resources; and,
- branding and design work.

1. This payout includes retroactive reimbursements and covering expenses borne by **dao-lawfirm.eth**, **tankbottoms.eth**, and **ryan-breslow.eth**.
2. This payout includes retroactive compensation to **tankbottoms.eth** and a number of development individuals.
3. This payout includes up to _$250,000.00_ to opportunistically purchase Juicebox Governance (JBX).
4. This payout includes ongoing expenses borne by **dao-lawfirm.eth** and **tankbottoms.eth** such as subscription services, hosting providers, Web3 providers, Fleek and other online services.

## Motivation

Currently, payouts are primarily managed by **tankbottoms.eth**, his private company Meow, and **dao-lawfirm.eth**, sometimes via advances from **ryan-breslow.eth**. This process is time consuming, cumbersome, and difficult to manage.

## Specification

### Multisig

The [DAO Multisig](https://gov.move.xyz/dao/governance/multisig) shall transfer 1,750,000 DAI to developer.movedao.eth ([`0x2187e6a7c765777d50213346F0Fe519fCA706fbD`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2187e6a7c765777d50213346F0Fe519fCA706fbD)), a Gnosis Safe which has the following five signers:

1. [`0x752515a3A1091b9f1c04416CF79D1F14d2340085`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x752515a3A1091b9f1c04416CF79D1F14d2340085) _(dao-lawfirm.eth)_
2. [`0x468f178672C86bFA02e5E1B0413C3ccf55A37409`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x468f178672C86bFA02e5E1B0413C3ccf55A37409)
3. [`0x550bD0F03580B9a687931af4d837F8e45D61d410`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x550bD0F03580B9a687931af4d837F8e45D61d410)
4. [`0xDbE76F6ae97dFD5bdd1D7DAD8972740d18aB2b57`](https://etherscan.io/address/0xDbE76F6ae97dFD5bdd1D7DAD8972740d18aB2b57)
5. [`0x746cf650d4E5431474E8D4E2d5B6Bbe53772b498`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x746cf650d4E5431474E8D4E2d5B6Bbe53772b498)

### Proposed Budget

See the [Proposed Budget](https://gov.move.xyz/pdf/mip-0003a.pdf), attached hereto as Exhibit A, and the [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mBO_eIWosiuarLAKx4IziPs9Iy1VDDKXGLGeqIPlIbA/edit?usp=sharing). This documents are high-level overviews and are subject to change.

### Utilization

Both the developer and business development budgets shall be utilized at the discretion of **tankbottoms.eth** and **jimmyethworld.eth**, with oversight from the Service Providers, including **dao-lawfirm.eth**. Additional signers will be added after a probationary period of ~30-90 days to ensure that the DAO's interests are being represented.

Business development and Operations will be managed by the development team. DAOLABS entities will be established to operate the DAO affiliates as to ensure that effective governance, accounting regulations, and property agreements are in place and enforced.

### Entities

The DAO and its advisors have agreed to utilize multiple partnered legal entities:

1. The DAO will fulfill non-profit functions, provide public goods, and have non-exclusive rights to intellectual property associated with the product. This implementation will be branded Movement DAO.
2. DAOLABS, LLC will retain intellectual property developed to date and engage with development staff.
3. This intellectual property will be licensed to DAOLABS, Inc: a for-profit corporation which will fulfill for-profit functions of the product. This includes collaborating with payment processor providers, cryptocurrency on-ramp and off-ramp providers, and other data services. DAOLABS, Inc will distribute options to individual contributors and stock to financial contributors, including potential future investors.

The Service Providers will create these entities, governance, and develop processes for ongoing governance, of while some portion of the above budget will be used for reimbursements of expenses, legal fees, and other costs. Upon completion of the entity formation the Service Providers will staff the entities with advisors, and board Members in order to establish proper governance.

## Rationale

The development team will be funded by this proposal have already created multiple dapps with feature sets relevant to the DAO platform:

### Core features

- The [Treasury Juicebox Multisignature Wallet](https://juicebox.wtf/). This frontend and backend constitute a complete re-implementation of the [Peel developed Juicebox frontend](https://juicebox.money). Not only does it feature several experimental features built from scratchâ€”it also compiles to a fraction of the Peel frontend's size, and is implemented from the ground up as Svelte components. Due to Peel's structure, it would be impossible to secure agreements with all the contributors of the existing code base and thus DAOLABS would be unable to apply any copyright, or dictate terms of use, including CC0.
- The [Identity Juicebox Multisignature](https://identity-develop.web.app/) features an expansive identification feature set. It allows users to connect with multiple Ethereum Cryptocurrency wallets, Phone based SMS authentication, Google, custom e-mail, Facebook, GitHub, Twitter, or to connect anonymously. By adding multiple authentication services, users can generate simplify the need to understand Cryptographic keys and instead default into a custodial Cryptocurrency account. This Dapp also employs multi-party computation to secure a wallet's seed phrase and private keys, transmits shards to two restoration services, and integrations to connect existing Gnosis Safes or to deploy new ones, each from a single Wallet provider. Additionally, this frontend provides Cryptocurrency on-ramps and off-ramps through credit cards, debit cards, and ACH transfers; Bolt payments was used for the credit/debit card integrations, as well as Wyre for fiat to Cryptocurrency transfers.
- [Membership NFT, Juicebox DAO](https://Membership.juicebox.wtf/) is a Juicebox frontend tailored towards creating treasuries funded by customizable tiered Membership NFTs. This frontend builds upon earlier work at [nft.juicebox.wtf](https://nft.juicebox.wtf/). This demonstrates focused onboarding scenarios and experiences for users, in attempts to simplify the onboarding process and thus the technical complexities of token system.
- [Bleeding-Edge](https://bleeding-edge.juicebox.wtf/) is a Juicebox Protocol frontend featuring customizable user pages and multiple no-code NFT collection creation workflows. This highlights tooling for DAOs and individuals to quickly and easily create content and deploy assets by which revenue may stream through a number of avenues: wallet, split contracts, and treasuries.
- [Staging Juicebox](https://staging.juicebox.wtf/) features further experimental features, such as a scrolling homepage and a project category selection menu. Usually this is the testing environment for juicebox.wtf and fully tested features.

### Additional Experiments

- [tiles.wtf](https://tiles.wtf) is a re-implementation of [tiles.art](https://tiles.art), which was an infinite generative NFT art project. tiles.wtf improves upon tiles.art by creating the art entirely on the Ethereum blockchain as SVG files (as opposed to using an API service), and also implementing a Juicebox treasury dashboard and donations page.
- [Juicebox Matic](https://matic.tankbottoms.xyz/) is a re-implementation of [juicebox.money](https://juicebox.money) on the Polygon blockchain.

These prototype dapps demonstrate the domain-specific expertise and skill of the prospective development team.

## Risks

- Transparent operation of the DAO is not certain or guaranteed.
- A Juicebox Protocol DAI terminal has not been deployed to mainnet, meaning these funds must be managed by Multisig wallets.
- These funds may not be ideally distributed.
- These funds may be more useful later on.
- The DAO is delegating major responsibility by approving a budget for 3 months.
