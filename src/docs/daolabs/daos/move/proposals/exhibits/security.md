:::warning
Movement DAO is new technology, and no amount of testing or security audits completely eliminate risks. Please don’t supply assets you can’t afford to lose. TLDR, at launch we are employing a Gnosis Multi-signature Safe to manage the DAO funds, Community Discord to coordinate discussions, and Snapshot, after the token distribution, for voting until the OpenLaw Tribute audit is complete.

#### Slow Start

Until Movement DAO is able to operate with confidence for some time, the following safe guards were put into place until the community deems them unnecessary. The safe guards are encoded into the adapters and extension smart contracts.

1. Financial transactions are handled after any votes by a IRL law firm acting as a service provider.
2. DAO founders may elect to operate with a Vetoer role which may veto any pending proposal.
3. A number of Movement DAO's Gnosis Safe signers are publicly known individuals.
