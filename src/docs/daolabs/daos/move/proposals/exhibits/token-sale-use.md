**TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF TOKEN SALE AND USE**

:::warning
PLEASE READ THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF TOKEN SALE AND USE CAREFULLY BEFORE ACCESSING THE WEBSITE LOCATED AT HTTPS://MOVE.XYZ (THE “WEBSITE”) OR THE MOVEMENT DAO (DEFINED BELOW) OR PURCHASING TOKENS. THE LAW OFFICE OF REED YURCHAK (THE "SERVICE PROVIDER") WILL ACT AS THE SERVICE PROVIDER FOR THE MOVEMENT DAO. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH PURCHASING THE TOKENS DESCRIBED HEREIN AND AGREE TO ASSUME SUCH RISKS UPON ANY PURCHASE OF TOKENS. IN ADDITION, NOTE THAT THESE TERMS CONTAIN A BINDING CLASS ACTION WAIVER, WHICH, IF APPLICABLE TO YOU, AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, DO NOT PURCHASE THE TOKENS DESCRIBED HEREIN.
:::

Prior to purchasing Tokens, you should carefully consider these Terms and, to the extent necessary, consult a lawyer, accountant, and/or tax professional, as applicable.

Purchases of Tokens should be undertaken only by individuals or companies that have significant experience with, and understanding of, the usage and intricacies of cryptographic tokens, including Ethereum-based tokens and blockchain-based software systems. Purchasers should have an expert understanding of the storage and transmission mechanisms associated with cryptographic tokens. While the DAO will be available to assist the Purchaser of Tokens during the Token Sale, the DAO will not be responsible in any way for loss of any cryptocurrency, including Tokens, resulting from actions taken by, or omitted by Purchaser. If you do not have such experience or expertise, then you should not purchase Tokens or participate in the Token Sale. Your participation in the Token Sale is deemed to be your understanding and acknowledgment that you satisfy the requirements mentioned in this paragraph.

As further described herein, by purchasing Tokens, and to the extent permitted by law, you agree to not hold the DAO or its respective past, present, and future employees, officers, directors, contractors, consultants, equity holders, suppliers, vendors, service providers, parent companies, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, representatives, predecessors, successors and/or designees liable for any losses or any special, incidental, or consequential damages arising from, or in any way connected, to the sale of Tokens, including losses associated with these Terms.

You acknowledge, understand and agree that:

:::warning
You are subject to and bound by these Terms by virtue of purchasing the Tokens.
:::

The Tokens have no rights, intended uses or attributes outside of use with the platform or as otherwise expressly referred to in these Terms.

- A purchase of Tokens is non-refundable and cannot be cancelled.
- A purchase of Tokens involves many, varied risks which can result in the loss of all amounts paid.
- The DAO reserves the right to refuse or cancel Token purchase requests at any time in its sole and absolute discretion.
- The Tokens are not backed by any physical bullion or other assets which a Purchaser would have any rights or access to.
- Other Token purchasers who made their purchase at a different time may receive more Tokens from the DAO for the same amount paid. In an effort to be completely transparent the tokens are priced on a bonding curve which is a function of the number of tokens voted by the community at any point in time and the token price is not due to any action by the DAO or any member of the community.

These Terms limit the liability of the DAO and its Associated Parties (defined below) in connection with the sale of Tokens.

**Right to review information of the Movement DAO**

You have reviewed to your satisfaction all supporting documents and collateral sources concerning the risks associate with purchasing Tokens.

NOTHING IN THESE TERMS SHALL BE DEEMED TO CONSTITUTE A PROSPECTUS OF ANY SORT, A SOLICITATION FOR INVESTMENT OR INVESTMENT ADVICE NOR DOES IT IN ANY WAY PERTAIN TO AN OFFERING OR A SOLICITATION OF AN OFFER TO BUY ANY SECURITIES IN ANY JURISDICTION. TO THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, EACH OF THE DAO AND KINESIS FOUNDATION (COLLECTIVELY, THE “ASSOCIATED PARTIES” AND EACH AN “ASSOCIATED PARTY”) EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM AND SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY AND ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY DIRECT OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR OTHER LOSSES OF ANY KIND, IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF REVENUE, INCOME OR PROFITS, AND LOSS OF USE OR DATA), ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH (I) THE PURCHASER’S ACCEPTANCE OF OR RELIANCE ON ANY INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THESE TERMS OR THE WHITEPAPER, (II) ANY ERROR, OMISSION OR INACCURACY IN ANY SUCH INFORMATION OR (III) ANY ACTION RESULTING THEREFROM.
