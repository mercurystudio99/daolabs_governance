**Why does the world need this?**

We believe that society already has the collective compassion, knowledge and resources to solve all of the worldâ€™s problems. We also know that the missing piece is a technology to bring it all together. Therefore we use proven applications of blockchain to connect the people within existing communities and empower them to solve problems together.With this project, we envision a world "enDAOment" that can provide continuous funding to the movements and initiatives that matter most to the community.

**Our vision for the future**

In the future, we believe people will demand engagement, transparency, expediency and collaboration in society, and a seat at the table when solving problems. We believe this platform will be what people turn to first when looking to start and fund movements.

**What is a DAO? And why do we need it?**

A DAO is an online community built on the blockchain that introduces powerful tools designed for collaboration, decentralization, and transparency without the need for trust. This combination allows us to quickly mobilize around our most important social movements and take action quickly.

**What is a "Movement"?**

Movement DAO supports movements, defined as communities organized around a shared mission. For example, social movements such as racial justice, environmental movements such as saving endangered species, or public goods movements such as art projects. For the first time ever, these movements have the infrastructure to finance their causes with economic alignment. For the first time ever, the infrastructure exists to prevent tragedy of the commons.

**What is an "initiative"?**

Initiatives are projects proposed by the movement community. Token holders vote on which initiatives receive funding. Funding is provided by the reserve pool & direct tributes. Funding is distributed incrementally when predetermined milestones are achieved. Initiatives are proposed with those milestones.

**What are the differences between $MOVE and $(Movement) tokens?**

MOVE tokens represent the potential to mint new movements and influence how the entire system is governed. In addition, the MOVE token is the native currency used to purchase movement tokens. Given this powerful utility and the inherent demand for $MOVE tokens, this token has the potential to appreciate in value over time as the ecosystem grows. The $MOVE ecosystem also earns movement tokens for each newly minted movement and revenue generated through network activity tributes. Revenue generated through network tribute goes towards the MOVE enDAOment.

**What is a Defi Endowment?**

The Defi Endowment is a pool of tokens (both $MOVE and $(Movement) tokens) that are owned by the governance DAO. This pool of assets is used to permanently generate income for funding movements and their initiatives. Income is generated through network activity related to trading and swapping of tokens, as well as yield farming of stablecoin assets.

**What are the benefits for token holders?**

Movement tokens have the potential to accrue value over time, as the price is directly tied to the growth of a movement community. Movement communities have the flexibility to set their own economic design including variables such as bonding curves, transaction tributes, vesting, and deflation. Movement tokens also represent voting rights for governance and funding initiatives. Like $MOVE token holders, $(Movement) token holders are incentivize to take action against malicious actors in their communities.

**How are tokens distributed?**

Both $MOVE and $(Movement) tokens are distributed via a mechanism called a bonding curve. A bonding curve is an encoded formula that determines the price of each incremental token that is minted (purchased) or burned (sold) based on the total supply. Instead of minting a large supply of tokens at the onset of the project, Movement DAO uses this minting and burning mechanism so that these communities are formed, grow and thrive as decentralized communities from the beginning. The bonding curve is not only ideal for ensuring decentralization, fairness, and stability, it is also an important element used for continuous funding for movements.

**How are initiatives funded?**

There are two primary forms of funding for initiatives: Passive and Active.

- Passive funding occurs when the movement community uses treasury reserves to fund initiatives. Passive funding takes time and requires continuous growth and activity such as minting, burning, and swapping of tokens.
- Active funding occurs when community members apply tributes to their votes. Tribute votes combine the signaling of which initiatives the voter wants to fund, and also attaches direct tributes of tokens IF those initiatives are selected. Those who tribute tokens earn a boost in their voting power.

**Why should I trust this platform?**

The Movement system is built in a way that designs bad behavior out of the system by using carefully designed incentive systems.
First, the use of bonding curve token distribution ensures that the project will be decentralized and community owned from the beginning. The founders tokens will be locked for 5 years from launch, meaning there is no return on investment to the founders until the platform is fully built, operational and successful in its objectives. The system also establishes trust with its community by adopting state of the art mechanism design concepts. We have built this system on the shoulders of giants. Users can rest assured that the underlying code has been audited for functionality and security.

**What are my responsibilities as a community member?**

There are various stakeholders and community members in the Movement DAO ecosystem. The primary stakeholders are $MOVE token holders and movement token holders. $MOVE tokens represent voting rights on the platform. Token holders are able to submit proposals and vote for governance changes as well as launch and influence new movements on the platform. $(Movement) tokens represent unique ecosystems designed specifically for supporting movements. Movement token holders are responsible for promoting, collaborating, and voting on how resources are allocated, and to which movement initiatives.

**How do I get involved in the community?**

- **As a movement evangelist** - Submit a proposal for a new movement or get involved in a new movement community. Movement evangelists are often those who are proposing new movements, however communities may find more influential leaders that can grow their communities better over time. Additionally, evangelists can choose to have delegates who they allocate a portion of their rewards to increase the scope of the network and its influence.
- **As a developer** - Join our Discord and stay active within the Developer channel. We encourage a collaborative developer community to help make the platform the best it can be.
- **As a community organizer** - Decentralized communities require community members that take on leadership roles to help organize and mobilize their respective communities to take action and work together. Communities will naturally identify skillful leaders and create incentives to keep them engaged in these important roles.
