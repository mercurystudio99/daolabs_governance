#### Costs

_What are the external costs involved with the DAO?_

DAOs are currently not universally recognized as legal entities. Therefore in addition to overseeing the assets of the DAO and how they are distributed by being one of the signers for the Gnosis Safe - service-provider.eth, the DAO through its members are responsible for the costs associated with its activities. This includes reviewing statements made in this GitBook, what the tokens maybe used for and what [Legal Disclaimers](./token-sale-use.md) and [Terms of Use](./tou.md) are acceptable given the current laws.

#### Fees and Expenses

Movement DAO developer contemplated the use of a service provider to help facilitate, for example, paying other service providers who may not be strictly anonymous or accepting of Ethereum. Currently an anonymous donor is paying for the fees associated with the service provider until the DAO governance if formed and snapshot votes render the will of its members.

Following other DAOs, with different charters, such as [Flamingo DAO](https://flamingodao.xyz/), specifically [Fees and Expenses](https://docs.flamingodao.xyz/FeesExpensesCarry.html), and the fees associated with their activities, we estimate spending 2% of the assets held per year on such legal services.

Upon the formation of the governance for Movement DAO, this will be submitted for the community vote via Snapshot.
