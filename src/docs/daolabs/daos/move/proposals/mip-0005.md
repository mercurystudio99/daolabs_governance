## Thesis

The DAO and its affiliates should establish traditional banking relationships so that those services can be integrated into its Dapp via API payment processors, thereby enabling payments in fiat currency; the DAO has integrated Bolt using internally generated API keys and Wyre API keys, both of which require traditional ACH accounts to connect and fulfill online account loading functions. Silicon Valley start-up services such as, **Ramp**, have business models where they offer "full-service" start-up services such as accounting management, including virtual cards by projects for expense management, cap-table, profit and losses, option and stock option turn-key packages and other organizational services normally left to the start-up. In order to be eligible for these types of services, the DAO or DAOLABS must have over $250,000.00 in an ACH account and documentation regarding capital investments. ACH accounts are also required for the DAO to open a Coinbase or Robinhood account which would be necessary for any fiat to crypto currency exchanges.

In order for a financial institution to establish a banking relationship with the **DAO**, the **DAO** must be able to provide traditional documents including board resolution, or shareholder resolution, or the information contained in Exhibit A, "Resolution to Open Bank Account" section.

## Motivation

The DAO's fiat contributions are currently facilitated by the **DAO's Service Providers** including **dao-lawfirm.eth**, via manual funds transfers and conversion from Cryptocurrency to fiat and vice versa using personal Accounts, likely generating gains or unforeseen tax liability which will need to be mitigated.

## Resolution

See Exhibit A. **RESOLUTION TO OPEN A BANK ACCOUNT**
