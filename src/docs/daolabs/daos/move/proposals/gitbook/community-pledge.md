title: 'Community Pledge'
---

At Movement DAO, our collective success relies on our ability to work together in harmony. We ask that all community members adhere to our eightfold pledge for building and maintaining communities in the right way.

1. Right view – Right view means that community members are aligned in their values and goals for global impact. Each community will become the product of our collective spirit, optimism and hard work in developing sustainable communities for positive impact.
2. Right intention – This platform is designed for real world impact. While other blockchain projects are designed for boosting economic status, we are here to turn this economic potential into changing the world. While the potential for comping EARNING is substantial, community members should consider this platform as a means to compound GIVING.
3. Right speech – Unlike social media platforms that are plagued with divisiveness and inflammatory discourse, this platform is designed for people to mobilize, collaborate and make impact together. We have no time to waste with distractions like divisive speech, abuse, or unrelated chatter.
4. Right action – Community members should be fully aligned with their intentions in both the physical world and the digital world. Community members should not use this platform to influence or manipulate the real world in a malignant way. Everyone should feel safe to express their opinions and contributions free from any malicious reaction. The community should engage in non-violent communication and conflict resolution. The community must build and maintain a level of trust by quickly highlighting any instances of fraudulent or malicious activity.
5. Right livelihood – It is possible for community members to grow their earn and make impact. There are several other platforms for those seeking lambos. We ask that community members don't let their earning potential detract from their giving potential.
6. Right effort – Each community member has a duty to prevent, mitigate, and resolve conflict on the platform.
7. Right mindfulness – Mindfulness means that community members are consciously aware of their own biases, preconceptions, and judgements. These tendencies can become blockages of new information and can lead to further misunderstanding and miscommunication. Community members should listen to others completely and practice mindful non-violent communication.
8. Right concentration – Community members should dedicate time to tasks within their communities instead of trying to multi-task. Problem solving is a dedicated effort and the communities need your focused wisdom and effort.
