This Snapshot proposal has been created to ratify the membership termination actions by the Authorized Members, benreed.eth and tankbottoms.eth.

## Thesis

The Authorized Members were concerned with certain Member's ("Certain Members") activities which were in violation of the DAO's [Code of Conduct](https://move.xyz/daolabs/daos/move/resources/code-of-conduct.md) and/or the DAO's [Guiding Principles](https://move.xyz/daolabs/daos/move/legal/guiding-principles.md) and/or the DAO's [Terms of Service](https://move.xyz/daolabs/daos/move/legal/tos.md) and/or the DAO's [Token Terms of Service](https://move.xyz/daolabs/policies/move-terms-of-service.md) and/or the DAO's [GitBook](https://move.xyz/daolabs/policies/gitbook/README.md). The Authorized Members disclosed all material information when they convened and sought independent counsel in order for them to render a fully-informed decision, with the goal of balancing the Service Provider's security concerns, membership privacy, as well as the DAO's need to maintain a healthy and vibrant community. Concerned with the current crypto-market sentiment, the Authorized Members felt the need to practice exceptional security precautions, operate with a high degree of transparency and accountability, and ensure that the DAO's treasury assets are protected.

The Certain Members are associated with the following addresses, who are also signers of the DAO's Gnosis Multi-Signature:

[0x550bD0F03580B9a687931af4d837F8e45D61d410](https://etherscan.io/address/0x550bD0F03580B9a687931af4d837F8e45D61d410)
[0x746cf650d4E5431474E8D4E2d5B6Bbe53772b498](https://etherscan.io/address/0x746cf650d4E5431474E8D4E2d5B6Bbe53772b498)
[0xDbE76F6ae97dFD5bdd1D7DAD8972740d18aB2b57](https://etherscan.io/address/0xDbE76F6ae97dFD5bdd1D7DAD8972740d18aB2b57)

Additionally, these addresses are also associated with the Certain Members:

[0x58Ba373d9eE46ED5402a6A15fE9CcADc67dE1650](https://etherscan.io/address/0x58Ba373d9eE46ED5402a6A15fE9CcADc67dE1650)

[0xb44A14dEcD9270E34E2dDaff4CD8690a2Cb88461](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb44A14dEcD9270E34E2dDaff4CD8690a2Cb88461)

## Motivation

To protect the DAO community from actions taken by the Certain Members that appeared to be malicious, exploitative, and in bad faith in order to protect the DAO's treasury and assets.

## Specification

1. Terminate any governance, voting, or community participation by the following addresses(s):

[0x550bD0F03580B9a687931af4d837F8e45D61d410](https://etherscan.io/address/0x550bD0F03580B9a687931af4d837F8e45D61d410)
[0x746cf650d4E5431474E8D4E2d5B6Bbe53772b498](https://etherscan.io/address/0x746cf650d4E5431474E8D4E2d5B6Bbe53772b498)
[0xDbE76F6ae97dFD5bdd1D7DAD8972740d18aB2b57](https://etherscan.io/address/0xDbE76F6ae97dFD5bdd1D7DAD8972740d18aB2b57)
[0x58Ba373d9eE46ED5402a6A15fE9CcADc67dE1650](https://etherscan.io/address/0x58Ba373d9eE46ED5402a6A15fE9CcADc67dE1650)
[0x211be2dDC09c482B27Ed780A710b18d8Cb76328E](https://etherscan.io/address/0x211be2dDC09c482B27Ed780A710b18d8Cb76328E)
[0xb44A14dEcD9270E34E2dDaff4CD8690a2Cb88461](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb44A14dEcD9270E34E2dDaff4CD8690a2Cb88461)

2. Remove the above listed addresses from Snapshot, and any position of trust they may hold.

## Rationale

- The Authorized Members convened, reviewed the [pertinent facts](/daolabs/daos/move/meeting/20230131.md) and resolved authorizing this action;
- dao-lawfirm.eth has resigned as the Service Provider leaving interim DAO oversight to the Authorized Members;
- Given the current crypto-market sentiment, practicing exceptional security precaution is expected and warranted;
- Multi-Signature Signer(s) should be comfortable with cryptographic transactions;

## Risks

- Authorized Members may have been compromised;
- The aforementioned individuals may not have the DAO's best interest in mind;
