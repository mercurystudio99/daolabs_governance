## Introduction.

Before being admitted as a DAO Member, each individual must accept and agree to abide by the DAO’s Code of Conduct (“Code of Conduct”). The Code of Conduct is comprised of the community standards (“Community Standards”) and the DAO’s community enforcement guidelines (“Community Enforcement Guidelines”). The Community Standards is a set of rules that Members must abide by when interacting with the Movement community or Dapp in any way, and the Community Enforcement Guidelines outlines actions that can and will be taken in the case of a violation of the Community Standards. The purpose of the Code of Conduct is to reinforce and enhance the DAO's ethical way of operating and, in particular, to provide regulations and procedures in how to do so.

Every Member must act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, and inclusive community. By participating in the Movement community, every Member agrees to make our community a harassment-free experience for everyone regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. Movement aims to be a tool and resource for anyone to use, thus every Member of Movement must act in-line with this ideology.

## Community Standards.

All Members (including Authorized Members, the Service Provider or its delegate) will be held to the Community Standards and are expected to abide by them at all times. Any and all violations of the Community Standards will be handled by the Authorized Members and/or Service Provider according to the Community Enforcement Guidelines, which are listed in detail below.

**Community Standards:**

1.  Members must act with honesty and integrity at all times;
2.  Members must provide information that is true, fair, accurate, timely and complete, and act in good faith, responsibly, with due care, competence, and diligence without misrepresenting or omitting any material facts at all times. Making false or misleading statements, records, or documentation, making misrepresentation or omission of a material fact in connection with Movement’s treasury or operational activities, or taking any action that could result in making Movement’s treasury or operational activities misleading is strictly prohibited;
3.  Members must not employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud Movement, engage in any act, practice, or course of business that operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit on Movement, or engage in any manipulative practice with respect to Movement;
4.  Members must maintain appropriate controls over all Movement assets and resources used;
5.  Members are prohibited from retaliating against any other Member for providing information or otherwise assisting in an investigation or inquiry in good faith regarding any conduct that a Member believes constitutes a violation of the Community Standards;
6.  Members must be respectful and cordial in all interactions with all other Members. Examples of a violation of this rule include harassment, the use of sexualized language or imagery, sexual attention or advances of any kind, insults, derogatory comments, harassment, and personal or political attacks;
7.  Members must not publish or reveal other Member’s private information (NCC and/or PII) without their explicit consent; and
8.  Members must not give financial advice to any other Member(s).

## Community Enforcement Guidelines.

If a Member violates the Community Standards in any way, they will be subject to the enforcement of disciplinary actions, based on these Community Enforcement Guidelines. The Authorized Members and/or Service Provider can and will take any and all actions necessary in order to properly execute the Community Enforcement Guidelines. Below are the five different types of disciplinary actions that can and will be enforced, based on the actions the Member took that constituted a violation of the Community Standards.

### 1. Correction.

**Transgression:** The use of inappropriate language or other unprofessional or unwelcome behavior.

**Consequence:** Deletion or removal of the content in question, along with a communication to the Member of which rule was violated and how to avoid such violations in the future.

### 2. Warning.

**Transgression:** A violation of the DAO's Code of Conduct, either through a single incident or a series of actions.

**Consequence:** A warning describing the consequences for continued inappropriate behavior. No interaction shall take place with the people involved (including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct) for seventy-two (72) hours. This includes interactions in Community spaces, as well as interactions through external channels like Telegram, Discord, Reddit, a Community Forum, or another platform. Violating this disciplinary action may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban.

**Transgression:** A serious violation of Community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence:** A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or communication with the Community for one-hundred-sixty-eight (168) hours. No interaction shall take place with the people involved (including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct) during this period. This includes interactions in Community spaces, as well as interactions through external channels like Telegram, Discord, Reddit, a Community Forum, or another platform. Violating this disciplinary action may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Compulsory Withdrawal.

**Transgression:** Demonstrating a pattern of violating Community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment, aggression, or disparagement towards individuals or classes of individuals.

**Consequence:** Permanent removal from any sort of interaction or public communication with the Community for an indefinite period of time. If an individual has alternate accounts, those may be removed as well. No public or private interaction with the people involved (including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct) shall take place during this period. This includes interactions in Community spaces, as well as interactions through external channels like Telegram, Discord, Reddit, a Community Forum, or another platform. The Compulsory Withdrawal must be approved by the Community through a Snapshot vote, and the Member who is the subject of the Compulsory Withdrawal will have the right to participate in the Snapshot vote.[^1]

### 5. Emergency Immediate Compulsory Withdrawal.

**Transgression:** A violation of the DAO's Code of Conduct, or the DAO's [Guiding Principals](https://move.xyz/daolabs/daos/move/legal/guiding-principles.md) that leads the Authorized Members and/or Service Provider to reasonably believe that emergency action needs to be taken in order to protect the DAO from any material adverse effect.

**Consequence:** The Member shall be banned from the Dapp and have all DAO privileges granted to them revoked (including governance and voting rights). Unlike a Compulsory Withdrawal, an Emergency Immediate Compulsory Withdrawal does not need to be approved by the Community through a Snapshot vote, and the Member who is the subject of the Emergency Immediate Compulsory Withdrawal will NOT have the right to participate in the Snapshot vote (See [Section 6(c) of the Guiding Principles](https://move.xyz/daolabs/daos/move/legal/guiding-principles.md#6-withdrawal-rights-compulsory-withdrawal-non-disparagement)).[^2]

## Disclaimers.

Views, statements and opinions expressed by a DAO Member do not necessarily reflect the opinions of the DAO Association or any of its affiliated entities, and shall be considered individual and personal statements of that DAO Member. The DAO shall not in any case be held responsible for any views, statements or opinions of any kind expressed by the DAO Member.
