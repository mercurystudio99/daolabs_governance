## Introduction.

These guiding principles constitute the Agreement ("Agreement") and is entered into by and amongst Members of DAO, also known as Move, an unincorporated nonprofit association organized under the **laws of the State of Delaware**.

The following terms apply when you:

- Click to view or access DAO's Dapp, DAO's online services or any of DAO's sites
- Contribute or transfer cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, or transfer one or more ERC-20s ("Token" or "Tokens"), ERC-721s ("NFTs"), or other digital assets (collectively, "Cryptographic Currencies") to the DAO
- Become a Member of DAO
- Receive DAO Governance Tokens
- Hold Governance Rights for the DAO
- Interact with or access [the DAO's smart contracts](/dao/resources/addresses) in any way
- Provide services to the DAO
- Donate or transfer any property to the DAO
- Or otherwise interact with or access any other of the DAO's services

DAO's governance may occur on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org); for the purpose of this agreement we refer to this as part of the DAO Dapp.

**By doing any of the above, you signify your agreement to these terms. If you do not agree to be bound by the Agreement in its entirety, you may not access, interact with, or use the DAO Dapp or online services in any way.**

Capitalized terms used herein have the meanings ascribed to them in the [Definitions](https://gov.move.xyz/dao/legal/definitions). Any terms which are defined herein supersede any definition contained in the associated document.

---

## 1. Organization.

**(a) Formation.** The DAO was formed on _February 1, 2022._ The obligations of Members of the DAO shall be determined pursuant to the Delaware Uniform Unincorporated Nonprofit Association Act, Del. Code Ann. Tit. 6, §§ 1901-1916 inclusive (the "Act"), and this Agreement.

**(b) Purpose.** The primary purpose of the DAO is to develop programmable, community-focused Ethereum treasury applications which can operate openly on the blockchain at any scale. The DAO additionally develops tooling to interact with existing financial infrastructure (including fiat), digital asset creation (e.g. NFTs), and marketplace applications to enable communities to participate in any type of lawful activity native to or related to Cryptocurrency. The purpose of the DAO is to remain solely within the scope of non-profit and charitable purposes, and purposes outside of this scope are not permitted. Please refer to the companion [purpose](https://gov.move.xyz/dao#purpose) section of this document for more details. Any terms which are contained herein supersede any definition contained in the associated document.

The DAO is an unincorporated association of individuals, corporations, statutory trusts, business trusts, estates, trusts, partnerships, limited liability companies, associations, joint ventures, and other legal or commercial entities, many of whom, if not all of whom, agree to join together for a common, nonprofit purpose. For the DAO, that purpose is encapsulated in its mission statement.

**The DAO is not intended to be or become an entity required to register as an “investment company” as defined in Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.**

## 2. Membership; Governance Rights and Tokens; Limitations.

**(a) Governance Rights.** Governance Rights in the DAO are represented by Project Tokens, with each Token representing a fractional part of the Governance Rights of all Members (or assignees, as the case may be) equal to the quotient of one (1) divided by the total number of Tokens claimed at any time. Member's Governance Rights are subject to [DAO Governance](https://gov.move.xyz/dao/governance/process).

**(b) Tokens.** As of the date hereof, there shall be an allowance of up to the max of 2(<sup>256-1</sup>)[^1] tokens authorized to represent Membership interests in the DAO, unless otherwise agreed to by the Members via a vote occurring through the Dapp. Membership in the DAO, as defined by Del. Code Ann. Tit. 6, § 1901, shall be voluntary and open to any individual whose purpose or presumed intent is to contribute to the DAO and is willing to accept the responsibilities and terms of Membership. The DAO shall grant the initial Member's governance voting tokens proportional to contributions to the DAO's Gnosis Multi-signature wallet.[^2]

Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, the DAO may provide initial Members Tokens for their role in conceiving and supporting the DAO.

**(c) Limitation to the DAO Protocol Configuration.** The DAO shall not configure its Juicebox Treasury with an undefined Reserved Rate, a Reserved Rate of 0%, a Redemption Rate of 100%, or a Discount Rate other than 0%. **The DAO shall not configure its Juicebox Treasury with any parameters that would cause the capital value of Token Redemptions via the Redemption Rate to exceed the cost basis required to issue those Tokens from the DAO's Juicebox Treasury.**

**(d) Admission.** The DAO is a decentralized network of Members, and Members collectively may admit or deny individuals for any arbitrary purpose or lack of purpose.

> **(i) Initialization.** On February 1, 2022, the DAO initiated a distribution of the DAO's NFT Collection to the top one-thousand (1500) addresses on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org) via a total usage count of Membership DAOs, authored proposals, and votes cast. The purpose of the NFT distribution was to foster a fair and equitable distribution of the governance NFT, to initialize the DAO community, and garner interest in directing the DAO development efforts. The DAO did not require any Membership contributions or fees to participate in this distribution. Contributions to the DAO's [Gnosis Multi-signature wallet](https://etherscan.io/address/0x143cC0A996De329C1C5723Ee4F15D2a40c1203c6) were separate. Contributions to the DAO's Multi-signature wallet represents the token distributions based on a computation of Cryptocurrency contributions to Project Tokens.
>
> **(ii) Distribution of Member Tokens.** All of the DAO's governing Members shall have their Membership determined upon receipt of voting tokens acquired on a public blockchain via contributions to the DAO's **Gnosis Multi-Signature Wallet (Etherscan Mainnet)** `0x143cC0A996De329C1C5723Ee4F15D2a40c1203c6`. The tokens are to be distributed on a bonding curve. DAO will operate as a Member Project which will issue Project Tokens to both Gnosis contributors and Member Projects, at rates yet to be determined. Cryptographic Units are used for participating in and improving the governance of the DAO through affirmative votes effectuated via the Designated Smart Contract (defined herein) or more commonly, Snapshot, the popular off-chain voting protocol **("Snapshot")** **(such processes are “Cryptographic Consensus”)**. Once the DAO admission requirements are met, a prospective Member's admission may be put up for a vote held among DAO Members. The DAO will consistently review admissions, and if necessary, Members may make adjustments to the DAO admission requirements based on their evolving needs and as agreed upon by Cryptographic Consensus. Notwithstanding, the DAO may admit all individuals who hold the DAO token by capturing an inventory of all current holders and ratifying the Membership at Governance intervals from time to time as registered by Cryptographic Consensus.
>
> The DAO may have more than one Member Tokens which has Membership purpose, such as the [Governance NFT available at 0xdd407a053fa45172079916431d06E8e07f655042](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdd407a053fa45172079916431d06e8e07f655042). The DAO shall authorize or discontinue the use of any Member Tokens from any Cryptographic Units at any time, or use a Member Token for a duration before migrating to another. The DAO, by a majority vote of the DAO Members, shall have discretion in how to fairly and equitably distribute Member Tokens, and/or the service of other governance tokens. The DAO shall, at its discretion, by the advice of the Service Provider, or by the majority vote of the DAO, retire governance tokens, including discontinuing Membership by Members holding the DAO governance token without any further notice.
>
> **(iii) Development of the DAO application.** Members are herein provided notice that any language within this agreement pertaining to future anticipated governance on additional DAO matters and applications may go through an eventual transitioning regarding the governance tooling and computation. The DAO is developing a governance application which it intends to use and provide all aspects of to Member Projects before the end of 2022.

**(e) Token Liquidity Pools.** The DAO shall not create any Liquidity Pools.

**(f) Governance Rights and Token Limitations.** _Governance Rights and the governance Tokens provide no possibility of profits and losses, no rights to distributions and dividends, and no rights to ownership or management of the DAO. Each Member (or assign, as the case may be) that receives or holds governance Tokens expressly and unequivocally agrees that the Tokens provide no rights to profits and/or losses, that the Tokens do not entitle their holder to distributions or dividends, and that the Tokens do not make their holder an owner or manager of the DAO._ Members who provide their Cryptographic Signature upon use of the Dapp shall agree with this section 2(f) explicitly and unequivocally, and will be deemed as to have read, understood, and sought counsel with regard to this section.

**(g) Token Reserved Rate.** Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, contributors to the DAO shall be entitled to receive Reserved Rate Tokens by a vote of the Members, via the Reserved Tokens list, as defined by the DAO's Juicebox Protocol configuration. Each Member expressly and unequivocally agrees to 2(f) above.

**(h) Responsibilities.** As of the date hereof, Members are not required to submit to any dues or Membership fees. However, in the event the Members agree otherwise via a vote occurring through the Dapp or Snapshot, each Member shall keep reasonably current in payment of any dues or Membership fees and other financial obligations of Membership, if applicable and determined by the DAO. Each Member shall notify the DAO of a Discord, Twitter, or other acceptable communication channel by which that Member may receive written or electronic materials required or permitted by this document, or shall notify the DAO that such Member lacks the standard acceptable addresses and designate a mutually acceptable form of communication.

If you have received any Tokens or are otherwise a Member, you consent and agree to become legally bound by this Agreement as both a participant in the DAO and more specifically a DAO "Member".

**(i) Information Rights.** Members shall have access to all information concerning operational and financial affairs of the DAO via

- **The Gnosis Multi-Signature Wallet**
  - [`0x143cC0A996De329C1C5723Ee4F15D2a40c1203c6`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x143cC0A996De329C1C5723Ee4F15D2a40c1203c6),
- **Etherscan and other Ethereum Block Explorers**
  - `https://etherscan.io/address/0x143cC0A996De329C1C5723Ee4F15D2a40c1203c6`, and
- **Snapshot**
  - `https://snapshot.org/#/movedao.eth`.

Otherwise, the DAO is not required to keep any records concerning legal, accounting, or other affairs, and aside from the above public information, the DAO shall not be required to maintain any additional records. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the DAO may engage with third parties to provide legal services, accounting services, and any record-keeping in order to comply with any legal obligations.

## 3. Liability.

**(a) No Member Liability.** Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or the Act, no Member (or former Member) shall be personally liable for the obligations of the DAO, including any obligations owed by any individual Member in connection with any breach of this Agreement. A debt, obligation, or other liability of the DAO is solely the debt, obligation, or other liability of the DAO. Members (or former Members) are not personally liable, directly or indirectly, by way of contribution or otherwise, for a debt, obligation, or other liability of the DAO solely by reason of being or acting as a Member or acting on behalf of the DAO. The failure of the DAO to observe formalities relating to the exercise of its powers or management of its activities and affairs is not grounds for imposing liability on a Member of the DAO for a debt, obligation, or other liability of the DAO.

**(b) Member Limitations.** No Member shall have the right or power:

> **(i)** to cause the dissolution and winding up of the DAO; or
>
> **(ii)** to demand or receive property, including any Cryptographic Currency or ERC-20 or ERC-721 Tokens ("Cryptocurrency Assets") contributed or otherwise transferred to the DAO, except as agreed to by the Members or otherwise provided herein.

## 4. Admission of Additional Members.

**(a)** Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the Members are authorized to accept additional donations from one or more Members, and to admit other Persons to the DAO as additional Members (each such additional Member and such existing Member is an "Additional Member"). Unless otherwise determined by the Members, any such Additional Members shall be admitted to the DAO only if such Member or Additional Member makes a donation or contribution via the Dapp.

**(b) Bound to Agreement.** Each person who is to be admitted as an Additional Member pursuant to this Agreement shall agree to be bound by all of the terms of this Agreement as if they were a Member from the inception of the DAO.

## 5. Management.

**(a)** Except as otherwise expressly required in this Agreement, the affairs of the DAO shall be carried on and managed exclusively by the Members, who shall have sole and absolute discretion with respect thereto. No Member shall be a manager, as defined under the Act.

**(b)** Whenever any action, including any approval, consent, decision, determination, or resolution is to be taken or given by the Members or the DAO under this Agreement or under the Act, it shall only be authorized by a majority vote of the Members via the Dapp or the DAO's Snapshot Spaces, unless otherwise provided herein. Such an authorization may be evidenced by a vote facilitated via the Dapp or the DAO's Snapshot Spaces and one or more smart contracts, or by a written consent, in accordance with this Agreement. The Members intend that any action (which has been duly approved in accordance with this Agreement) taken by the DAO via a Dapp, a smart contract, or the blockchain shall be a valid action of the Members or the DAO, as applicable, and no Member shall challenge the authority or validity of any such action based solely on such a fact.

**(c)** Except as otherwise expressly required or stated in this Agreement or in the Act, no single Member (in their capacity as a Member) shall be an agent of the DAO, have authority to bind the DAO in any way, or have the authority to enter into any agreement or contract obligating the DAO in any way unless approved via a vote occurring through the Dapp or the DAO's Snapshot Spaces.

**(d)** To the extent that the Members have approved a document in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Act, any Member may hereby be expressly authorized to execute and deliver such a document on behalf of the DAO.

**(e)** Members may appoint a proxy to vote or otherwise act for the Member with regards to the DAO pursuant to the Dapp or the DAO's Snapshot Spaces.

**(f)** The DAO has the right to delegate certain technical or administrative responsibilities to third parties and provide them with reasonable compensation.

**(g) Reliance by Third Parties.** Persons dealing with the DAO are entitled to only rely conclusively upon the power and authority of the Members (and any Person to whom the Members have delegated any such power and authority pursuant to this Agreement) by an explicit governance ratification of such power and authority. Therefore, any acknowledgement that such Member or assign is authorized to act on behalf of the DAO and may bind the DAO or otherwise enter into a binding contract may only be relied upon as evidenced by the DAO governance process as defined by Dapp or the DAO's Snapshot Spaces proposals.

**(h) Other Activities.** Each Member acknowledges and agrees that in addition to transactions specifically contemplated by this Agreement, and subject to applicable law, certain Members within the DAO and their respective Affiliates and Representatives are each hereby authorized to obtain property or obtain services from, to provide property or provide services to, or otherwise enter into any transaction with certain Members, or any Affiliate or Representative of any of the foregoing Persons, pursuant to clear approval via the Dapp and DAO governance.

## 6. Withdrawal Rights; Compulsory Withdrawal; Non-Disparagement.

**(a) Limited Right to Withdraw.** A Member may withdraw at any time by transferring its Tokens to a third party. Such a withdrawal shall be facilitated and executed, in part, using one or more smart contracts, and shall be effective as of the date of transfer. Any withdrawal is irrevocable. Alternatively, a Member may redeem the entirety of the Tokens held by sending the tokens to the Juicebox Protocol, where the tokens will be burned, thereby reducing the total Project Token supply. In return, the Member may receive **some portion** of their initial or cumulative DAO Membership holdings in Ethereum (or other Cryptographic Currency). A Member who burns the entirety of their token holdings shall be deemed to have withdrawn from the DAO. The DAO shall not be obligated to pay any interest or other compensation to a Member who redeems or withdraws its Tokens.

**(b) Compulsory Withdrawal.** Not in limitation of Section 6(a), Members acting by vote via the Dapp or the DAO's Snapshot Spaces proposals may have any Member withdrawn from the DAO to the extent that such Members, in their reasonable discretion, determine it to be necessary, desirable, or appropriate, including without limitation to comply with applicable law or regulations, or to avoid a material adverse effect on the DAO or the other Members. For the avoidance of doubt–the Member proposed to be withdrawn shall be entitled to vote on their own withdrawal from the DAO.

**(c) Emergency Immediate Compulsory Withdrawal For Cause.** Not in limitation of Section 6(a), 6(b), the Service Provider, in their reasonable discretion, is expressly authorized to remove a Member without notice or vote of the Members if the Service Provider determines such a removal to be necessary, desirable, or appropriate, including, without limitation, to comply with applicable law or regulations, or to avoid a material adverse effect on the DAO. For the avoidance of doubt–the Member to be compulsorily withdrawn shall be entitled to vote with respect to any vote of the Members regarding such compulsory withdrawal, unless the Member is deemed to be in violation of the [Code of Conduct](https://gov.move.xyz/dao/resources/code-of-conduct) and [Community Enforcement Guidelines](https://gov.move.xyz/dao/resources/code-of-conduct#community-enforcement-guidelines).

**(d) Non-Disparagement.** Not in limitation of Section 6(a), 6(b), 6(c) and 6(d). During the term of their DAO Membership, and thereafter, any Member shall not make any disparaging remarks, or any remarks that could reasonably be construed as disparaging regarding the DAO, its Members, its affiliates, or its agents. The DAO shall, except to the extent otherwise required by applicable laws, rules, or regulations, or as appropriate in the exercise of the [Community Enforcement Guidelines](https://gov.move.xyz/dao/resources/code-of-conduct#community-enforcement-guidelines) and the [Terms of Service](https://gov.move.xyz/tos), exercise reasonable efforts to cause the following individual(s) to refrain from making any disparaging statements, orally or in writing, regarding the DAO, its Members, or agents during and after the Membership period.

>
> **(ii)** DAO Expenses shall be allocated to and paid for by the DAO.

## 8. Distributions; Dividends; Compensation.

**(a)** The DAO shall not make any distributions of any kind and it will not pay dividends of any kind to any Member or director/officer or other person who may have an ownership interest in the DAO.

**(b)** The DAO may pay reasonable compensation or reimburse reasonable expenses to a Member or third-party for services rendered, confer benefits on a Member or third party in conformity with its nonprofit purposes, repurchase a Membership and repay a contribution made by a Member to the extent authorized by this Agreement, or make distributions of property to Members upon winding up and termination to the extent permitted by this Agreement.

## 9. Dissolution.

**(a) General.** The DAO shall be dissolved and its affairs shall be wound up upon the earliest to occur of:

> **(i)** a determination of the Members by Majority Vote; or
>
> **(ii)** the entry of a decree of judicial dissolution pursuant to the Act.

**(b)** Upon the dissolution of the DAO, assets shall be distributed for one or more exempt purposes which are within the meaning of section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code or the corresponding section of any future federal tax code and which are consistent with the goals and purpose of the DAO, or the assets shall be distributed to the federal government, or to a state or local government, for a public purpose. Any such assets not so disposed of shall be disposed of by a court of competent jurisdiction of the county in which the principal office of the DAO is then located, exclusively for such purposes or to such organization or organizations, as said Court shall determine, which are organized and operated exclusively for such purposes.

## 10. Limitations on Transfers.

**(a) Transfers.** Governance Rights and Tokens are not transferable, except to other Members. Members may vote to allow or disallow the ability of Members to transfer their Governance Rights and/or Tokens by a vote facilitated via the Dapp. Tokens may become freely transferable to Ethereum addresses outside of the DAO ("External Addresses") by a vote of the Members. In the event the Tokens become freely transferable to External Addresses, you agree that holders of External Address which Tokens are transferred to shall automatically be granted Membership rights, subject to this Agreement.

**(b) Admission of Substituted Members.** If the transferee is not already a Member, any transferee of Tokens transferred in accordance with the provisions of this Section shall be admitted as a Member. The DAO shall not for any purpose recognize any purported transfer of all or any part of a Member's interest or Tokens in the DAO, and no purchaser, assign, transferee, or other recipient of all or any part of such Tokens shall become a Member hereunder unless:

> **(i)** The transferee pursuant to this Section that is admitted to the DAO as a transferee Member shall succeed the rights and liabilities of the transferor Member with respect to such transferred Tokens.
>
> **(ii)** Effect of Death, Dissolution, or Bankruptcy. Upon the death, incompetence, bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, or dissolution of a Member, the rights and obligations of that Member under this Agreement shall accrue to that Member's successor(s), estate, or legal representative, and each such Person shall be treated as an unadmitted transferee of that Member's Tokens, as described in the Act.

## 11. Books and Records; Accounting and Tax Matters.

**The DAO shall not be obligated to keep any books or records beyond what is made available via the Dapp, the DAO's Snapshot Spaces proposals, or available via the Ethereum blockchain.**

## 12. Waiver of Fiduciary Duties.

**(a)** Except as expressly set forth in this Section, in the event that any Member initiates any Proceeding against the DAO, and a judgment or order not subject to further appeal or discretionary review is rendered, that Member shall be solely liable for all costs and expenses related to the Proceeding and/or judgment or order from the Proceeding.

**(b) Limitation by Law.** No provision of this Agreement shall be construed to provide for the indemnification for any liability to the extent (but only to the extent) that such indemnification would be in violation of applicable law, but instead shall be construed so as to effectuate the provisions thereof to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

**(c) Waiver of Fiduciary Duties.** To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or otherwise of applicable law, including any in equity or at law, no Member shall have any fiduciary duty to the DAO or to any Member by reason of this Agreement or in its capacity as a Member, except that the Members shall be subject to the implied contractual covenant of good faith and fair dealing and the terms and provisions of this Agreement. The provisions of this Agreement, to the extent that they restrict or eliminate the duties and liabilities of the Members otherwise existing at law or in equity, are agreed by the parties hereto to replace such other duties and liabilities of the Members. Members can exercise any rights under this Agreement consistent with this Agreement.

## 13. Intellectual Property Rights.

**(a) Grant of Rights.** All DAO members, and any Members that join in the future, **grant to the DAO, and its affiliate DAOLABS, LLC**, a perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free license and right, and all ancillary and subsidiary rights therein and thereto, throughout the world, to use, edit, modify, include, incorporate, adapt, record, reproduce, display, and archive any copyrightable work associated with any written copy, source code, illustrations, and artwork (the **"Work"**) in any manner whatsoever, in or out of context, by any and all means and/or devices and in any and all media now or known hereafter–all in connection with the production, exhibition, distribution, exploitation, advertising, marketing, publicity, and promotion of the DAO and its Purpose. The term of this license begins whenever a contribution is made through the Site by a Person entering into this Agreement as a Member or is subsequently admitted as a Member pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (i.e., any and all Members).

Licensor shall indemnify and hold Licensee (and its agents, Affiliates, assigns, heirs, or other successors in interest) harmless from any claim, loss, liability, damage, or expense (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of any claim, lawsuit, or demand which is inconsistent with or arises out of warranties or representations in this Section.

**(d) Limited Field of Use.** Notwithstanding the preceding provisions, the DAO shall not use Members' Work for any purposes other those defined in the Section 13(a), which includes use by the DAO within its field of use as defined in its Purpose in Section 1, including any for-profit endeavors, with the exception, however, of the purposes of any derivative rights by the DAO which it is obligated to grant to DAOLABS, or its affiliates for use of or within the licensed Dapp, and any contributions to the DAO where the DAO compensates the Member for the Work.

## 14. Derivative Matters.

**(a) No Derivative Actions.** No Member shall have the right to bring any action or proceeding in any court or before any arbitrator or other tribunal against the DAO or any other Member on account of any alleged or actual breach of this Agreement or any other agreement or instrument to which the DAO is a party or by which it is bound, or for any other purpose whatsoever, except as expressly provided in this Agreement.
