## About.

The DAO and its community are building a platform for creating blockchain-based treasuries and communities which can operate at any scale.

- If you would like to join the DAO as a contributor, read [How to Contribute](contribute).
- If you are building (or would like to build) a sustainable, high-impact project with a focus on social good, reach out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/movexyz).

Movement DAO uses proven applications of blockchain to align economic incentives within communities and empower them to solve problems as a collective; Movement DAO enables communities to run programmable and community funded treasuries by providing tooling and a seeded endowment.[^1] The community is just as vital as the developer team not only to the success of Movement DAO, but also for the DAO to maintain true decentralization. The community must build and maintain a level of trust by quickly highlighting any instances of fraudulent or malicious activity. Each community member has a duty to prevent, mitigate, and resolve conflict on the platform. [^2]

With that said, in order to be sure that the DAO and the community are aligned in their mission to use the Movement tools for positive contributions and impacts on the world, Movement DAO holds veto powers on any movements or initiatives that break the community guidelines.[^3]

## Purpose.

The primary purpose of the DAO is to enable Ethereum treasuries which are:

- transparent;
- turnkey;
- extensible;
- scalable;
- community-focused;
- compatible with existing banking infrastructure; and,
- legally compliant.[^4]

The DAO's applications are coordinated through Gnosis Safes, the Juicebox protocol, and smart contracts.[^5]

The DAO is building:

- legal frameworks which enable associations and entities to utilize cryptocurrencies;
- legal structure/governance document generators;
- diverse NFT tooling for creators and communities;
- tools for treasury diversification and token management;
- on-chain and off-chain governance tools;
- reputation scoring and ranking for treasuries, communities, and individuals; and,
- a Cryptocurrency wallet solutions which:
  - simplifies Cryptocurrency on/off-boarding;
  - enhances Cryptocurrency wallet management;
  - natively implements Multi-signature wallets, including Gnosis Safes;
  - simplifies Multi-signature management and interaction; and,
  - integrates with traditional banking and credit/debit cards.

While also:

- supporting JuiceboxDAO and the Juicebox protocol's community;
- enabling and fostering public goods and community-focused projects;
- developing sustainable public/private good community models; and,
- developing a sustainable endowment fund for Member projects and Core Contributors.

The DAO is focused and determined on creating a sustainable, long-term oriented project, with the hopes of allowing the community to grow and flourish with it. Therefore, the founderâ€™s tokens will be locked for 6 years from launch, meaning there is no return on investment to the founders until the platform is fully built, operational and successful in its objectives. The system also establishes trust with its community by adopting state of the art mechanism design concepts.[^6]

The DAO enables treasury creators to create and deploy tightly integrated Crypto-native products, thereby providing rich, sustainable opportunities for treasuries (and contributions to those treasuries) to thrive and scale. The DAO also oversees and manages the DAO's Endowment which funds the DAO's applications, manages the DAO's endowment capital, and provides ecosystem grants as proposed by the DAO's contributors.[^7] Given each Movement has its own property and funds which are managed by Movement, and adapters and extensions which govern how the funds are collected, distributed, and managed are all areas which require extensive design, analysis, and audit before it is employed on Ethereum Mainnet.[^8]

The DAO is a [Delaware Unincorporated Nonprofit Association](/dao/legal/guiding-principles), operating with contributions to its [Gnosis Safe](https://etherscan.io/address/0x143cC0A996De329C1C5723Ee4F15D2a40c1203c6), which amount to [$16,271,642.46 as of August 10, 2022](/dao/governance/gnosis). The initial signers of the DAO's Gnosis Safe were coordinated by dao-lawfirm.eth, the DAO's Service Provider. DAOLABS, LLC. provides all the intellectual property the DAO will use via a perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free license and right, and all ancillary and subsidiary rights therein within the field of use of the DAO's non-profit charter.
