The Collection tool is what we call our nft minting application, or minter tool. This creation tool is a powerful and complex tool which we have strived to simplify without sacrificing the features or capabilities. To quickly communicate and demonstrate its power we have created several examples of each type of project which we are making available here for you to download and explore.
