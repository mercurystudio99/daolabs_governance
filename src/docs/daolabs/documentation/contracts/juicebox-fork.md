DAOLABS has forked the [Juicebox v3 protocol](https://github.com/DAOLABS-WTF/juice-contracts-v3), the fork contains modifications which revolve around the following:

1. United States (U.S.) regulatory compliance;
2. Protocol fee configuration;

Despite these changes, DAOLABS has made an effort to keep the fork as close to the original protocol as possible.
