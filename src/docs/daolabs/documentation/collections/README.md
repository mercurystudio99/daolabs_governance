title: Collections

Collections are a way to group NFTs together. They are a way to organize NFTs and provide a way to display them in a more organized way. While an NFT is defined by its name, symbol and each of the token's metadata. Collections are additional richer information that can be added of which a subset will be used for the [Contract-level metadata](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/contract-level-metadata) which OpenSea uses.

### Create NFTs

The first option presented to a user in creating an NFT are high-level concepts or types which are optimized for a user's workflow. However, prior to our ability to streamline a particular workflow, the option 'Advanced' contains the most granular options for creating an NFT. Import, as the name implies, allows users to easily load a project configuration which was previously created and exported. This is particularly useful for collaborative projects or where one project requires another user to control the Collection.

At the beta launch, we expect to have Edition, Generative, Advanced, and Import options available.
