## THE APP

Effort is underway to better convey the names of the various DAOs and parties involved in the DAOLABS ecosystem. For example, DAOLABS, MovementDAO, PeaceDAO, and the development application website currently using the [Juicebox](https://juicebox.money) branding, in fact, this is an artifact of the fork - we decided to not introduce complexity to the development process by redesigning the site at the same time as expanding the application tooling.

Development efforts are underway to brand the new application as well as the sections related to DAO and Digital Objects tooling which will replace the hodgepodge of applications currently employed. To that end, we are exploring branding for both the organization, decentralized application, specific applications for DAOs and Digital Objects. We will update this space when we make sufficient progress.

A new font we are experimenting with is called Dreamland Font. See [Dreamland](https://www.fontspace.com/dreamland-font-f2495) and if you want to review the current UX development efforts, we have enabled public access to the [DAOLABS UX](https://www.figma.com/file/8orucP9iXPsWnPhJa1guUF/JB-Treasury-UX?node-id=5007-107637&t=OoY2klwZJAhZWpmi-0).
