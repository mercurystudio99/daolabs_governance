## THE MARK

<p align="justify">
The DAOLABS logo and mark consists of DAO and LABS intersecting each other. Being our mark, it identifies with our product applications. Additionally, our designer has created a number of DAOLABS stamps which we apply frequently: from document labelling to governance rewards.</p>

<p align="justify">
The DAOLABS logo was designed by the venerable [Natalia Pankina](https://natasha-pankina.com), our swiss army designer, illustrator, and overlord of all things pixel. Natalia is responsible for creative illustrations across the UX and application control surfaces. Her branding efforts for DAOLABS and DAO-KIT have been made available for ecosystem participants wishing to reference our tools. Please review our [branding guidelines and terms of uses](/legal/policies/terms-of-service-application.md) if you have any further questions.</p>

### OFFICIAL LEGALESE DOCUMENT

<div class="grid-container">
    <div>        
        <p align="justify">
        Unlike the acronym might suggest, DAOs, both registered and unregistered alike, do not "govern themselves"—one can quickly be buried within a sea of legal paperwork. The writer's last few months have been a non-stop legalese fever dream,  coming dangerously close to full legal comatose.</p>
        <p align="justify">
        In an attempt to break the apparent ocean of clauses and terms, Natalia created an Official Legalese Seal both to be informative and to clearly label materials so that they are not accidentally read for casual reasons, for pleasure, or for passing the time. When you see this mark, rest assured that the following text will be extremely boring.

### ZERO ETH HOURLY RATE

<p align="justify">
We understand how hard it is to get good advice regarding the operation of your DAO, what tools you should use, and how you should legally wrap your DAO (if at all). When creating a DAO, you are basically creating an entity, regardless of the mechanics dictating decision-making and the allocation of funds. *Zero ETH Hourly Rate* is our commitment to make contracts, governance templates, and legal resources accessible for free through our DYOR and form-based contract templates. Knowing that not everyone will be comfortable with free resources, we are searching for willing community members and identifying funding for community consulting services to help with your governance process so you can focus on your community.

### THE CROSSROADS

<p align="center">
    <img src="/images/daolabs/daolabs-logo-default.png" alt="Branding Logo Default" width="350px">
</p>

<p align="justify">Our logo embodies DAOLABS' position at the intersection of many disciplines. As we develop Ethereum smart contracts, we make every effort to optimize code we deploy—we compress content, such as text, images, and JSONs; Natalia has compressed as well, optimizing the use of an "A" in two separate words. DAOLABS bridges intersections between crypto and web3, startups, DeFi enthusiasts, creative communities and artists, and DAO purists. To that end, we find ourselves at a crossroads—both metaphorically and literally.</p>

<p align="justify">Meant to be the start of a golden ratio or Michelangelo's Vitruvian Man, the logo exhibits heavenly and numinous symmetry and proportions as presented in the crossroads.</p>

<br />

### STACKED

<p align="justify">An early rendition of the DAOLABS logo employed the following stacking and alignment experiments. Metaphorically, we want to create tooling which tears down barriers to entry and removes walls for anyone interested in crypto. We liken the state of crypto today to the early stages of the dot-com era. In order to grow the ecosystem, we are fully invested in onboarding the next one billion people into crypto.</p>

<p align="justify">We utilized block text for DAOLABS because of its resemblance to ascii artwork—some of which we include in our smart contract deployments.</p>

### BADGES

<p align="justify">POAPS SCHMOAPS.</p>

<p align="justify">These perfectly circular logos, complete with tag line enhancements, are DAOLABS' secret weapon: at a glance, they appear formal and business-ready—but at closer inspection it's a party all day.</p>

<p align="justify">The DAOLABS badges are our favorite, and are also Natalia's trademark. Not only do they make great profile pictures and POAPs—we enjoy using them for stamping documents, products, and experiences; and the circular frame around DAOLABS not only gives us the ability to both convey more information, but also allows us to add some humor to this tagline-rich world we live in.  Below are a few of our favorite badges:</p>

### THE CHEVRON

<p align="center">
    <img src="/images/daolabs/v-black-white.png" alt="Branding Logo" width="500px" />    
</p>

<p align="justify">
Optimized for developer t-shirts, *THE CHEVRON* is notoriously attractive. Its hard lines, sharp edges, and subtle shading are known to leave observers bewildered. The "party-line" is to say that the text configuration resembles a check mark; however, it is well known that *THE CHEVRON* is in actuality a life-changing piece of art.
