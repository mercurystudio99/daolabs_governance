title: Resolutions

_Resolutions_ are documents created by a board of directors which detail a binding corporate action.

Resolutions are subject to the **business judgement rule**.

According to the Montgomery County [Department of Housing and Community Affairs](https://montgomerycountymd.gov/DHCA/housing/commonownership/business_judgment_rule.html):

> _Defined in very general terms, the business judgment rule says that the decisions of the governing body of an association and its members—usually the board of directors—are assumed to be correct, and the courts will therefore uphold them unless certain conditions are met._
>
> _Or, put another way, when a dispute over the validity of a decision of the board is brought before a court, the court will not substitute its own judgment of what is best for the association in place of the judgment of the board of directors, so long as the board acted properly._
