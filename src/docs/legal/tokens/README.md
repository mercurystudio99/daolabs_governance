Equity agreements allow employees, investors, service providers, or other individuals or entities to purchase, earn, or otherwise receive a share of ownership in your entity (equity). Companies often use equity agreements in addition to traditional compensation or as a mechanism for securing funds.

The documents in this section are like Simple Agreements for Future Equity (or SAFEs), but for cryptocurrency tokens. These are often referred to as Simple Agreements for Future Tokens (or SAFTs).

## Documents

- The [Short Simple Agreement for Future Tokens](/legal/tokens/saft.md) allows an entity to designate future tokens to employees as a form of compensation.
- The [Long Simple Agreement for Future Tokens](/legal/tokens/safe.md) is another commonly used agreement to promise a future distribution of tokens.
- The [Form of Confirmation Notice](/legal/tokens/safe-exhibits.md) is an exhibit to be used in combination with the Long Simple Agreement for Future Tokens.
