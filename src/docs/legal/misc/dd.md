It is unknown if the practice is still in effect, but normally for a $50m Series A due diligence a team of 4 accountants would visit the target company and over see the collection of the following information. At the due diligence conclusion, the team members would provide their manager and, subsequently their client with an intangible "confidence score" on how prepared, organized, transparent and competent the team responding. It is a good habit to be aware of what investors, customers, partners are interested in and make best efforts to conduct your finances, accounting, and corporate affairs as if a due diligence team is always around the corner.

Obviously this precludes and forecloses any remote activities which may be construed as "financial shenanigans".
