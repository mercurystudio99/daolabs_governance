**3. Assignment Consent.** Vendor hereby agrees that in connection with the close of **[Entity-name]**'s anticipated sale of substantially all of its assets to **[Purchaser-name]** or one of its affiliates ("**Purchaser**"), **[Entity-name]** shall have the right to assign the Prior Agreement and the Amendments, both between the parties, to Purchaser; **provided**, **however**, that Purchaser agrees in writing to be bound by the terms of such agreements.

**5. Representations and Warranties by Company.** The Company hereby represents and warrants, as a material condition to this Agreement, that it is not engaged in any litigation proceedings.

**6. No Assignment.** Vendor represents and warrants that it has not assigned or surrogate any said claim, duty, obligation, cause of action, action, right judgment, obligation, demand accounting, liability or damages, or authorized any other person or entity to assert such a claim, duty, obligation, cause of action, action, right, judgment, obligation, demand, accounting, liability or damages on its behalf.

> A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.
