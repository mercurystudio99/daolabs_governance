title: Limited Liability Company (LLC)
---

According to the [U.S. Small Business Administration](https://www.sba.gov/business-guide/launch-your-business/choose-business-structure):

> _LLCs protect you from personal liability in most instances, your personal assets — like your vehicle, house, and savings accounts — won't be at risk in case your LLC faces bankruptcy or lawsuits._
>
> _Profits and losses can get passed through to your personal income without facing corporate taxes. However, members of an LLC are considered self-employed and must pay self-employment tax contributions towards Medicare and Social Security._

- LLCs must be filed with state authorities.
- Depending on elections made by the LLC and the number of members, the IRS will treat an LLC as either a corporation, partnership, or as part of the LLC’s owner’s tax return (a “disregarded entity”).
- Most states do not restrict ownership, so members may include individuals, corporations, other LLCs and foreign entities. Most states also permit “single-member” LLCs, those having only one owner.

LLCs are useful for separating personal debts and assets from business debts and assets. This makes LLCs an attractive option for investment clubs, or for projects purchasing real estate or other property.
