**WHEREAS**, the DAO was formed by filing the Certificate of Formation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on [Entity-formation-date] to build a limited liability decentralized organization utilizing the Ethereum network;

**WHEREAS**, the parties hereto desire to build a smart contract based democratically managed organization to make, develop, and invest in digital assets and non-fungible token offerings via the Member’s efforts in digital asset-related projects.

**NOW, THEREFORE**, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:

## ARTICLE I.

### DEFINITIONS

#### 1.1 **Definitions.**

Capitalized terms used herein have the meanings ascribed to them in Exhibit A hereto.

## ARTICLE II.

### ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS

#### 2.1 **Name.**

The name of the DAO shall be [Entity-name], LLC. The DAO shall have the exclusive ownership of and right to use such name as long as the DAO is in existence. The business of the DAO may be conducted under that name or, upon compliance with applicable law, under any other name that the Management Committee deems appropriate or advisable.

#### 2.2 **Term.**

The Parties hereto as of the Effective Date, by execution of this Agreement and the filing of the Certificate of Formation, hereby form the DAO as a limited liability DAO under and pursuant to the Act as of the Effective Date. The term of the DAO commenced on the Effective Date and will continue in full force and effect until the DAO is terminated pursuant to Article XIII. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Member agrees to be bound by the terms and obligations of this Agreement for as long as such Member holds Units.

#### 2.3 **Office and Agent.**

The principal office of the DAO shall be at [Entity-full-address] or at such other place as the Management Committee may determine from time to time, which need not be in the state of Delaware. The DAO may also have such offices as the Management Committee may from time to time determine. The name and business address of the registered agent of the DAO required by the Act to be maintained in the State of Delaware is [Registered-agent-name] or as may otherwise be determined by the Management Committee from time to time.

#### 2.4 **Purpose of DAO.**

The primary purpose of the DAO is

(a) [Entity-purpose] ("DAO Investments" or "Investments");

(b) to acquire, hold, manage, and dispose of DAO Investments; and

(c) to hold, invest, and manage Investment assets in the possession of the DAO, in each case in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Not in limitation of the foregoing, the DAO is to function as a limited liability for-profit decentralized smart-contract based organization, denominated in cryptocurrency, through which the Members may elect to invest in a variety of underlying projects for which investments will be denominated in cryptocurrency. The DAO shall have the power to do any and all acts necessary, appropriate, desirable, incidental, or convenient to or in furtherance of the purposes described in this Section 2.4, including, without limitation, any and all of the powers that may be exercised on behalf of the DAO by the Members or Management Committee pursuant to this Agreement. Except as otherwise expressly provided to the contrary in this Agreement, the purpose and scope of the DAO shall also include any other lawful action or activity permitted by a limited liability DAO agreement formed pursuant to the Delaware Act.

#### 2.5 **Classification for Tax Purposes; No State Law Partnership.**

It is the intent of the Members that the DAO shall always be classified as a “partnership” for Federal and state income tax purposes and not as an association taxable as a corporation. The Members intend that the DAO not be a partnership (including, without limitation, a limited partnership) or joint venture, and that no Member be a partner or joint venturer of any other Member, for any purposes other than as set forth in the preceding sentence, and this Agreement shall not be construed to produce a contrary result.

#### 2.6 **Foreign Qualification.**

Prior to the DAO’s conducting business in any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware, the Management Committee shall cause the DAO to comply with all requirements necessary to qualify the DAO as a foreign limited liability company in that jurisdiction if the nature of its business makes such qualification necessary. At the request of the Management Committee, each Member shall execute, acknowledge, swear to, and deliver all certificates and other instruments conforming with this Agreement that are necessary or appropriate to qualify, continue, and terminate the DAO as a foreign limited liability company in all such jurisdictions in which the DAO may conduct business.

#### 2.7 **Interest Register.**

The Management Committee will maintain a register (“Interest Register”) that sets forth the name, contact information, commitment, Capital Contributions, and Interest of each Member. The Interest Register will be available to each Member at request of such Member. Each Member shall promptly provide, upon request, the Management Committee with the information required to be set forth for that Member on the Interest Register and shall promptly notify the Management Committee of any change to that information. The Management Committee, or a designee of the Management Committee, shall update the Interest Register from time to time as necessary to accurately reflect the information therein as known by the Management Committee, including, without limitation, admission of new Members, but no update will constitute an amendment for purposes of Section 15.1. Any reference in this Agreement to the Interest Register will be deemed to be a reference to the Interest Register as amended and in effect from time to time.

#### 2.8 **Title to Assets.**

All assets of the DAO will be deemed to be owned by the DAO as an entity, and no Member, individually, will have any direct ownership interest in those assets. Each Member, to the extent permitted by applicable law, hereby irrevocably waives its rights to a partition of the assets of the DAO and, to that end, agrees that it will not seek or be entitled to a partition of any assets, whether by way of physical partition, judicial sale, or otherwise.

#### 2.9 **Base Currency.**

Except as otherwise agreed in writing by Members acting by a Majority Vote:

(a) the base currency of the DAO shall be digital assets, including but not limited to, Ethereum, Bitcoin, stablecoins (DAI, USDC, USDT, etc.) or any digitally wrapped derivate of such digital asset thereof (a "Digital Asset");

(b) each reference to "dollars," "$," or "cash" (or any derivation thereof) in this Agreement shall be interpreted to mean the equivalent of such amount in an applicable Digital Asset;

(c) all subscriptions, withdrawal proceeds (if any), and distributions shall be paid in the base currency determined by the DAO; and

(d) the Membership interests in the form of Units (as defined below) shall simultaneously be denominated as the DAO Tokens.

Units shall be expressed in whole or in fractions and shall be represented as [Entity-token-name], which are cryptographically secured tokens utilizing the Ethereum network ("DAO Tokens") and operated by each member to record their transactions in the DAO. As of the date hereof, there shall be [Entity-token-total-supply] Units authorized for issuance by the DAO. The DAO shall issue to each Member, [Entity-tokens-issued] Units for a minimum of [Minimum-token-purchase-amount] of Capital Commitments made by such Member, unless otherwise agreed to by the Members via a vote occurring through [Governance-process].

receive property other than cash in return for its Capital Contributions.

#### 6.1 **Temporary Investments.**

The Members acting by Majority Vote shall have the right, but not the obligation, to elect to invest capital contributions made to the DAO in one or more of the following investments ("Temporary Investments"): (a) Ether; (b) Bitcoin; and/or (c) fee or interest-bearing Digital Assets; or (d) or any other Digital Assets, including, but not limited to non-fungible tokens.

#### 6.2 **Proposal and Approval of Investments.**

Any Member (the "Proposing Member") that identifies a potential investment opportunity for the DAO (a "Potential DAO Investment") shall propose to the other Members the opportunity to invest in such investment opportunity through [Governance-process]. The Proposing Member shall notify the other Members of the opportunity to invest in the Potential DAO Investment through [Governance-process] and shall provide to the other Members sufficient information to assess the DAO Investment (the "Potential DAO Investment Notice"). Such Potential DAO Investment Notice shall be delivered to such other Members through [Governance-process]. If Members acting by the voting mechanism provided by [Governance-process] and the underlying DAO smart contracts elect to invest in such Potential DAO Investment within four (4) days following delivery of the Potential DAO Investment Notice, then the DAO shall invest in such Potential DAO Investment. Such approval shall be communicated to the Proposing Member and the other Members through [Governance-process].

If a Potential DAO Investment has been approved in accordance with this Section, then the DAO shall invest in such opportunity and each then-current Member (other than a Member that has permissibly withdrawn all of its Undeployed Capital in accordance with Limited Right to Withdraw Undeployed Capital) shall participate in such DAO Investment on a pro rata basis, based on the relative Units of such Members. For the avoidance of doubt, every then-current Member (other than a Member that has permissibly withdrawn all of its Undeployed Capital in accordance with Section 7.1) shall participate in each Potential DAO Investment that has been approved in accordance with this Section, regardless of whether such Member voted in favor of such investment. Notwithstanding anything in this Section to the contrary, a Member may be relieved of its obligation to participate in a DAO Investment if, in the sole and absolute discretion of the Management Committee, such participation would cause such Member to violate any law or regulation applicable to such Member.

#### 6.3 **Co-Investment.**

The DAO may offer any Member, any Member’s Affiliates, and/ or any other Person (including the Management Committee, its Affiliates, and their respective Representatives) the right to co-invest with the DAO (directly or indirectly) in any DAO Investment.

The withdrawal shall be facilitated and executed, in part, using one or more smart contracts and shall be effective as of the date indicated by the withdrawing Member in the notice provided to the DAO.

(a) Each date on which a Member may withdraw all or any portion of its Undeployed Capital is referred to herein as a "Withdrawal Date."

(c) The Units of a Member to be withdrawn shall remain invested in the DAO after such Member has given notice of its intention to withdraw and until the Withdrawal Date (if different from the date on which the withdrawal notice is provided). Following such Withdrawal Date, the number of Units held by such Member and such Member’s Capital Commitment shall be proportionally reduced to reflect the withdrawal of such applicable portion of such Member’s Undeployed Capital.

(d) Payments of withdrawal proceeds shall be facilitated by one or more smart contracts. Notwithstanding the foregoing regarding the payment of withdrawal proceeds or anything else to the contrary in this Agreement, the Management Committee may establish limited reserves and holdbacks for estimated DAO Expenses, liabilities, and/or contingencies attributable to any period prior to the applicable Withdrawal Date, including general reserves for unspecified contingencies, which will reduce the amount of a distribution upon withdrawal.

(e) Any withdrawal is irrevocable and may only be rescinded with the consent of the Members acting by Majority Vote (excluding the Member seeking to rescind such withdrawal notice). Any transaction expenses that are incurred by the DAO with respect to such revoked withdrawal request, may be charged to such Member as determined by the Members acting by Majority Vote (excluding the rescinding Member).

#### 7.2 **No Other Withdrawal Rights.**

Except as set forth in Section 7.1, or as otherwise agreed in writing by the Members acting by Majority Vote (other than the Member seeking to withdraw), no Member shall have the right to withdraw its capital or profits from the DAO, or to demand and receive any DAO property, in exchange for such Member’s Units in the DAO. Each Member acknowledges and agrees that DAO Investments are illiquid.

#### 7.3 **Compulsory Withdrawal.**

Not in limitation of Section 5.2, upon written notice delivered to such Member, the Members acting by Majority Vote may cause a Member to be compulsorily withdrawn from the DAO to the extent that such Members, in their reasonable discretion, determine it to be necessary, desirable, or appropriate, including, without limitation, to comply with applicable law or regulations, or to avoid a material adverse effect on the DAO or the other Members. For the avoidance of doubt, the Member proposed to be compulsorily withdrawn shall be entitled to vote with respect to any vote of the Members regarding such compulsory withdrawal.

## ARTICLE VIII.

### DISTRIBUTIONS

#### 8.1 **Amount, Timing, and Form.**

Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Members shall determine the amount, timing, and form (whether in cash, in kind, in cryptocurrency, or in any Digital Asset) of all distributions made by the DAO via a vote in the DAO’s underlying smart contracts facilitated through [Governance-process]. No distribution shall occur before all Units in the DAO are issued, unless otherwise agreed to by the Members via a vote occurring through [Governance-process].

#### 8.2 **Distributions in Kind.**

Each class of securities to be distributed in kind shall be distributed to the Members in proportion to their respective share of the proposed distribution, as provided in this Agreement, as the case may be, except to the extent that a disproportionate distribution of such securities is necessary to avoid distributing fractional shares.

#### 8.3 **Discretionary Distributions.**

Distributable proceeds shall be distributed on a Member-by-Member basis on a pro rata basis based on the relative Units held by each Member. (i) If a Member does not participate in a DAO Investment, such Member shall not be entitled to any distributions with respect to such DAO Investment and the distributions made to each of the other Members shall be modified accordingly.

#### 8.4 **Tax Withholding.**

If the DAO incurs any obligation to pay any amount in respect of taxes (including withholding taxes and/or any interest, penalties, or additions to tax) imposed on income of or distributions made to any Member or former Member, any amount so required to be paid by the DAO with respect to such Person shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as if it had been loaned to such Person, and the Management Committee shall give prompt written notice to such Person of the date and amount of such loan. Each Member covenants, for itself, its successors, assigns, heirs, and personal representatives, that such Person shall pay to the DAO at any time after notice of the loan has been given, but not later than five (5) Business Days after the Management Committee delivers a written demand to such Person for such repayment (which demand may be made at any time prior to or after the dissolution of the DAO or the withdrawal of such Person or its predecessors from the DAO); provided, however, that if any such repayment is not made within such five (5) Business Day period: (i) such Person shall pay interest to the DAO at a rate equal to eight percent (8%) for the entire period commencing on the date on which the DAO paid such amount and ending on the date on which such Person repays such amount to the DAO together with all accrued but previously unpaid interest; and (ii) the DAO as determined by the Members by Majority Vote may (a) collect such unpaid amounts (including interest) from any DAO distributions that otherwise would be made to such Person.

#### 8.5 **Certain Distributions Prohibited.**

Notwithstanding anything in this Article VII: (a) no distribution shall be made to any Member if, and to the extent that, such distribution would not be permitted under the Delaware Act; and (b) no distribution shall be made to any Member to the extent that such distribution, if made, would cause the deficit balance in the Capital Account of such Member.

#### 8.6 **No Reinvestment of Distributable Proceeds.**

For the avoidance of doubt, unless otherwise determined by Members acting by Majority Vote, the DAO shall not reinvest (or retain for investment) any distributable proceeds to effect DAO Investments but shall be permitted to retain distributable proceeds to pay DAO expenses or to fund reserves for reasonably anticipated DAO expenses, liabilities, or reserves.

#### 8.7 No Recall of Distributions in Kind.

Distributions shall not be recalled from the Members.

## ARTICLE IX.

### CAPITAL ACCOUNTS; ALLOCATIONS

#### 9.1 **Capital Accounts.**

A Capital Account shall be established and maintained for each Member in accordance with the following provisions:

(a) To each Member’s Capital Account, there shall be credited such Member’s capital contributions, such Member’s distributive share of Profits, and any items in the nature of income or gain that are specially allocated pursuant to this Agreement, and the amount of any liabilities of the DAO that are assumed by such Member, or that are secured by any assets of the DAO distributed to such Member.

(b) To each Member’s Capital Account, there shall be debited the amount of cash and the Gross Asset Value of any DAO assets distributed to such Member pursuant to any provision of this Agreement, such Member’s distributive share of Losses, and any items in the nature of expenses or losses that are specially allocated pursuant to this Agreement, and the amount of any liabilities of such Member assumed by the DAO or that are secured by any property contributed by such Member to the DAO.

(c) If ownership of any Unit in the DAO is assigned in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the assignee shall succeed to the Capital Account of the assignor to the extent it relates to the assigned Unit.

(d) In determining the amount of any liability for purposes of Subsections 10.a.i and 10.a.ii above, there shall be taken into account Code Section 752(c) and any other applicable provisions of the Code and Treasury Regulations.

(e) To each Member’s Capital Account, there shall be debited or credited, as the case may be, such adjustments as are necessary to reflect a revaluation of DAO assets to reflect the Gross Asset Value of all DAO assets, as required by Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f) and Section 9.b hereof.

The foregoing provisions and the other provisions of this Agreement relating to the maintenance of Capital Accounts are intended to comply with Code Section 704 and Regulations Section 1.704-1(b) and shall be interpreted and applied in a manner consistent with such Regulations. The DAO shall make any adjustments that are necessary or appropriate to maintain equality between the Capital Accounts of the Members and the amount of DAO capital reflected on the DAO’s balance sheet as computed for book purposes in accordance with Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(q).

#### 9.2 **Revaluations of DAO Property.**

The "Gross Asset Value" of any asset of the DAO shall be equal to the asset’s adjusted basis for federal income tax purposes, except as follows:

(a) The initial Gross Asset Value of any asset contributed by a Member to the DAO shall be the gross fair market value of such asset, as determined by the contributing Member and the Members (other than the contributing Member) by Majority Vote.

(b) The Gross Asset Values of all DAO assets shall be adjusted to equal their respective gross fair market values in connection with (and to be effective immediately prior to) the following events: (i) the acquisition of an additional Units in the DAO by any new or existing Member in exchange for more than a de minimis capital contribution; (ii) the distribution by the DAO to a Member of more than a de minimis amount of property (including cash) as consideration for an interest in the DAO; (iii) the grant of an interest in the DAO (other than a de minimis interest) as consideration for the provision of services to or for the benefit of the DAO by an existing Member acting in the capacity of a Member or by a new Member acting in the capacity of a Member or in anticipation of being a Member; or (iv) the liquidation of the DAO within the meaning of Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(g); provided, however, that an adjustment pursuant to clauses (i), (ii), or (iii) above shall be made only if such adjustment is necessary or appropriate to reflect the relative economic interests of the Members in the DAO.

(c) The Gross Asset Value of any DAO asset distributed to any Member shall be the gross fair market value of such asset on the date of distribution.

(d) The Gross Asset Values of DAO assets shall be increased (or decreased) to reflect any adjustments to the adjusted bases of such assets pursuant to Code Section 734(b) or Code Section 743(b), but only to the extent that such adjustments are taken into account in determining Capital Accounts pursuant to Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m) and Section 10.a hereof; provided, however, that Gross Asset Values shall not be adjusted pursuant to this Subsection to the extent they were adjusted pursuant to this Section 9, in connection with a transaction that otherwise would result in an adjustment pursuant to this Subsection.

(e) If the Gross Asset Value of an asset has been determined or adjusted pursuant to this Section 9, such Gross Asset Value shall thereafter be adjusted by the Depreciation considered with respect to such asset for purposes of computing Profits and Losses.

#### 9.3 **Allocations of Profit or Loss.**

Profits or Losses for any Accounting Period shall be allocated among the Members in such a manner that as closely as possible gives economic effect to the provisions in Article VIII.

## ARTICLE X.

### FEES AND EXPENSES

#### 10.1 **Expenses.**

(a) The DAO shall maintain reserves from the assets of the DAO (including Capital Contributions made by the Members) for the payment of the expenses, liabilities and obligations of the DAO, including for taxes, contingent liabilities or probable losses or foreseeable expenses, in such accounts and in such amounts that the Management Committee deems necessary or appropriate, subject to increase or reduction at the Management Committee’s sole discretion. All organizational and operating costs and expenses of the DAO will be paid by the DAO excluding any regulatory expenses, or other costs incurred by the Management Committee in connection with its daily operations, including but not limited to salary and other payments to employees of the Management Committee.

(b) The Management Committee will, to the extent of available funds of the DAO, pay or cause to be paid, all DAO operating costs and expenses (“DAO Expenses”) incurred by the DAO or on its behalf, including (i) out-of-pocket expenses that are associated with disposing of Investments, including transactions not completed; (ii) extraordinary expenses, if any (such as certain valuation expenses, litigation and indemnification payments); (iii) interest on borrowed money, investment banking, financing and brokerage fees and expenses, if any; (iv) expenses associated with the DAO’s tax compliance costs, tax returns and Schedules K-1, custodial, legal and insurance expenses, any taxes, fees or other governmental charges levied against the DAO; (v) attorneys’ and accountants’ fees and disbursements on behalf of the DAO; (vi) insurance, regulatory or litigation expenses (and damages); (vii) expenses incurred in connection with the winding up or liquidation of the DAO; (viii) expenses incurred in connection with any amendments to the constituent documents of the DAO, and related entities; (ix) except as set forth in Section 4.5(a), all out of pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Management Committee in connection with its services as such to the DAO; and (x) expenses incurred in connection with the distributions to the Members and in connection with any meetings of the Members called by the Management Committee.

(c) DAO Expenses shall be allocated to and funded by the Members pro rata in accordance with their relative Capital Commitments; provided, that DAO Expenses attributable to a DAO Investment will be allocated to and fund by only those Members participating in such DAO Investment, pro rata in accordance with their relative Capital Commitments invested in such DAO Investment. The Members, acting by Majority Vote, also may determine that any one or more DAO Expenses shall be allocated on an alternative basis, provided that such alternative basis is more equitable.

(d) If the Management Committee determines at any time, or from time to time, that the available funds of the DAO (after the drawdown of any then unfunded Commitments) are not sufficient to pay the DAO’s operating costs and expenses, then the Management Committee may, but is not required to, loan its own funds to the DAO for the payment of such costs and expenses (an “Advance”). The DAO shall reimburse the Management Committee for any such Advance together with interest on such Advance from the date of such Advance at an annual rate of [Management-committee-reimbursement-interest-rate]. Any such Advance, together with the interest thereon, shall be an expense of the DAO and shall be paid by the DAO prior to making any further Distributions. Payments by the DAO shall be applied first to accrued interest on and then to the principal of such Advance. The determination to apply funds of the DAO to the payment of such Advance shall be at the Management Committee’s discretion. For the avoidance of doubt, an Advance by the Management Committee will not constitute a Capital Contribution by the Management Committee.

(e) If the Management Committee does not make an Advance, then the Management Committee shall notify the Members and describe in reasonable detail the operating costs and expenses requiring additional DAO funds. Such notification shall also state the aggregate amount of additional Capital Contributions (“Additional Capital Contributions”) being requested from the Members and each Member’s pro rata share of such amount. (such a request, a “Capital Call”) Within 15 days following the date of such Capital Call (the “Deadline”), each Member may, but is not obligated to, make an Additional Capital Contribution in an amount equal to its pro rata share (based on its Interest) of the aggregate amount of the Additional Capital Contributions requested by the Management Committee. An Additional Capital Contribution made by a Member shall be treated as having been received on the later of the Deadline with respect to the applicable Capital Call or the date on which such Additional Capital Contribution is actually made.

(f) If any Member (the “Non-Contributing Member”) fails to make any Additional Capital Contribution (or any portion thereof) requested by a Capital Call (a “Shortfall Amount”) by the Deadline, the Management Committee shall notify each Member that is not a Non-Contributing Member in respect of such Capital Call (a “Contributing Member”) of the aggregate Shortfall Amount in writing, and each Contributing Member may elect to make a further Additional Capital Contribution in the amount of such Shortfall Amount (or a portion thereof). If more than one Contributing Member elects to make a further Additional Contribution, the Shortfall Amount shall be allocated to such Contributing Members pro rata based on their Interests, but not in excess of the actual Additional Capital Contribution such Contributing Member has elected to contribute. Such further Additional Capital Contributions shall be made within 15 days after the Deadline.

### INDEMNIFICATION

#### 14.1 **Limitation of Liability.**

Unless explicitly agreed upon, the debts, obligations and liabilities of the DAO, whether arising in contract, tort or otherwise, will be solely the debts, obligations and liabilities of the DAO, and will not be those of the Members, the Management Committee, and their Affiliates, and each of their respective officers, directors, shareholders, partners, members, trustees, beneficiaries, employees, agents, heirs, assigns, and successors-in-interest, (collectively, “Indemnified Persons”).

#### 14.2 **Standard of Care; Liability.**

The Indemnified Persons will not have any personal liability whatsoever to the DAO, any Member, or their Affiliates on account of that Indemnified Person’s role within the DAO or by reason of that Indemnified Person’s acts or omissions in connection with the conduct of the business of the DAO so long as that Person acts in good faith for a purpose which the Indemnified Person reasonably believes to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the DAO. Notwithstanding the preceding, nothing contained in this Agreement will protect that Indemnified Person against any liability to which that Indemnified Person would otherwise be subject by reason of

(a) any act or omission of that Indemnified Person that involves gross negligence, willful misconduct, bad faith, fraud, or willful and material breach of a material provision of this Agreement or any Subscription Agreement or any management agreement or other agreement with or for the benefit of the DAO;

(b) any transaction from which that Indemnified Person or its Affiliate derives any improper personal benefit; or

(c) a breach of any representation or warranty by such Member made in this Agreement or its Subscription Agreement.

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the DAO shall indemnify and hold harmless each of the Indemnified Persons from and against any and all losses, damages, liabilities and expenses, (including costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts (collectively, “Liabilities”) reasonably incurred by any such Indemnified Person in connection with the defense or disposition of any action, suit or other proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative and whether threatened, pending or completed (collectively a “Proceeding”), in which any such Indemnified Person may be involved or with which any such Indemnified Person may be threatened, with respect to or arising out of any act performed by the Indemnified Person or any omission or failure to act if

(a) the performance of the act or the omission or failure was done in good faith and within the scope of the authority conferred upon the Indemnified Person by this Agreement or by the Act, except for acts of willful misconduct, gross negligence or reckless disregard of duty, or acts which constitute a material breach of this Agreement or from which such Indemnified Person derived an improper personal benefit or

(b) a court of competent jurisdiction determines upon application that, in view of all of the circumstances, the Indemnified Person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnification from the DAO for such Liabilities as such court may deem proper. The DAO’s indemnification obligations hereunder shall apply not only with respect to any Proceeding brought by the DAO or a Member but also with respect to any Proceeding brought by a third party.

#### 14.4 **Contract Right; Expenses.**

The right to indemnification conferred in this Article XIV shall be a contract right and shall include the right to require the DAO to advance the expenses incurred by the Indemnified Person in defending any such Proceeding in advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that, if the Act so requires, the payment of such expenses in advance of the final disposition of a Proceeding shall be made only upon receipt by the DAO of an undertaking, by or on behalf of the indemnified Person, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such Person is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article XIV or otherwise.

#### 14.5 **Indemnification of Officers and Employees.**

The DAO may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Management Committee, grant rights to indemnification and to advancement of expenses to any officer, employee, or agent of the DAO to the fullest extent of the provisions of this Article XIV with respect to the indemnification and advancement of expenses of Members and Managers of the DAO.

For these purposes “control” means the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a Person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise. For the avoidance of doubt, no Member will be deemed, solely by virtue of that membership, to be an Affiliate of the DAO.

4. **“Bankruptcy”** of a Member means the institution of any proceedings under any federal or state law for the relief of debtors, including the filing by or against that Member of a voluntary or involuntary case under the federal bankruptcy law, which proceedings, if involuntary, are not dismissed within sixty (60) days after their filing; an assignment of the property of that Member for the benefit of creditors; the appointment of a receiver, trustee or conservator of any substantial portion of the assets of that Member, which appointment, if obtained ex parte, is not dismissed within sixty (60) days thereafter; the seizure by a sheriff, receiver, trustee or conservator of any substantial portion of the assets of that Member; the failure by that Member generally to pay its debts as they become due within the meaning of Section 303(h)(1) of the United States Bankruptcy Code, as determined by the Bankruptcy Court; or that Member’s admission in writing of its inability to pay its debts as they become due.

5. **“Capital Account”** of a Member means the capital account of that Member determined from the inception of the DAO strictly in accordance with the rules set forth in Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv) of the Treasury Regulations. In the event that assets of the DAO other than cash are distributed to a Member in kind, Capital Accounts shall be adjusted for the hypothetical “book” gain or loss that would have been realized by the DAO if the distributed assets had been sold for their fair market values in a cash sale (in order to reflect unrealized gain or loss). In the event of the liquidation of the DAO, Capital Accounts shall be adjusted for the hypothetical “book” gain or loss that would have been realized by the DAO if all DAO assets had been sold for their fair market values in a cash sale (in order to reflect unrealized gain or loss).

6. **“Capital Commitment”** means, with respect to any Member at any time, the amount specified as such Member’s Capital Commitment at the time such Member was admitted to the DAO (adjusted as provided in this Agreement including in connection with any increase in such Member’s Capital Commitment pursuant to Section 4.3), which amount shall be recorded and evidenced on the Ethereum network.

7. **“Capital Contribution”** of a Member, at any particular time, means the amount of money, property, or other assets which that Member has theretofore contributed to the capital of the DAO, net of liabilities assumed or to which the assets are subject.

13. **“Initial Closing Date”** means the day on which all of the necessary documents have been executed and delivered by the Members thereto, and all conditions precedent to (i) the Members’ obligations to pay the initial Capital Contribution amount and (ii) the DAO’s obligations to deliver the Units, in each case, have been satisfied or waived.

14. **“Majority Vote”** means the approval of Members holding at least a majority-in-interest, i.e. 50% or more, of all Units.

15. **“Management Committee”** means the Management Committee of the DAO established pursuant to Section 5.

16. **“Member”** and **“Members”** means each Person executing this Agreement as a member or subsequently admitted as a member pursuant to the terms of this Agreement to acquire Units in the DAO but does not include any Person that has ceased to be a Member of the DAO. If at any time there is only one Member, then all references to "Members" shall be deemed to mean "Member."

17. **“Interests”** or **“Units”** means a Member’s ownership interests in the DAO, including, without limitation, that Member’s share of the DAO’s Net Profits, Net Losses, Net Proceeds or other Distributions, its right to inspect the books and records of the DAO and its right, to the extent specifically provided in this Agreement, to participate in the business, affairs and management of the DAO and to vote or grant consent with respect to matters coming before the DAO.

18. **“Person”** means any entity, corporation, DAO, association, joint venture, joint stock DAO, partnership, trust, limited liability DAO, limited liability partnership, real estate investment trust, organization, individual (including personal representatives, executors and heirs of a deceased individual), nation, state, government (including agencies, departments, bureaus, boards, divisions and instrumentalities thereof), trustee, receiver or liquidator.

19. **“Portfolio Project”** means an entity in which the DAO has made a DAO Investment.

20. **“Profits”** and **“Losses”** means, for each Accounting Period, an amount equal to the DAO’s taxable income or loss for such Accounting Period, determined in accordance with Code Section 703(a) (for this purpose, all items of income, gain, loss, or deduction required to be stated separately pursuant to Code Section 703(a)(1) shall be included in taxable income or loss), with the following adjustments: Income that is exempt from federal income tax and not otherwise taken into account in computing Profits and Losses shall be added to such taxable income or loss. Any expenditures of the DAO described in Code Section 705(a)(2)(B), or that are treated as Code Section 705(a)(2)(B) expenditures pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(i) and not otherwise taken into account in computing Profits and Losses pursuant to this definition, shall be subtracted from such taxable income or loss. If the Gross Asset Value of any asset is adjusted pursuant to Section 9.b or Section 9.c, the amount of such adjustment shall be taken into account as gain or loss from the disposition of such asset for purposes of computing Profits and Losses. Gain or loss resulting from any disposition of assets with respect to which gain or loss is recognized for federal income tax purposes shall be computed by reference to the Gross Asset Value of the assets disposed of (as adjusted under this Agreement), notwithstanding that the adjusted tax basis of such property differs from its Gross Asset Value.

    In lieu of the depreciation, amortization, and other cost-recovery deductions taken into account in computing such taxable income or loss, there shall be taken into account Depreciation for such Accounting Period as defined hereinafter. For such purposes "Depreciation" means, for each Accounting Period, an amount equal to the depreciation, amortization, or other cost-recovery deduction allowable with respect to an asset for such Accounting Period, except that if the Gross Asset Value of an asset differs from its adjusted basis for federal income tax purposes at the beginning of such Accounting Period, Depreciation shall be any amount that bears the same ratio to such beginning Gross Asset Value as the federal income tax depreciation, amortization, or other cost-recovery deduction for such Accounting Period bears to such beginning adjusted tax basis; provided, however, that if the federal income tax depreciation, amortization, or other cost-recovery deduction for such Accounting Period is zero, Depreciation shall be determined with reference to such beginning Gross Asset Value using any reasonable method selected by the DAO.

    To the extent an adjustment to the adjusted tax basis of any asset pursuant to Code Section 734(b) or Code Section 743(b) is required pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(4) to be taken into account in determining Capital Accounts as a result of a distribution other than in liquidation of a Member’s interest in the DAO, the amount of such adjustment shall be treated as an item of gain (if the adjustment increases the basis of the asset) or loss (if the adjustment decreases the basis of the asset) from the disposition of the asset and shall be taken into account for purposes of computing Profits and Losses.

    Notwithstanding any other provision of this definition, any items that are specially allocated pursuant to Section 11.a shall not be taken into account in computing Profits and Losses. The amounts of the items of DAO income, gain, loss, or deduction available to be so specially allocated shall be determined by applying rules analogous to those set forth in this definition.

    The DAO’s distributive share of any Profits and Losses (as defined herein) from any partnership (including any limited liability company or other entity treated as a partnership for tax purposes) in which it holds an interest, adjusted to avoid taking into account any items otherwise reflected in the DAO’s Profits and Losses, shall be included in the DAO’s Profits and Losses.

21. **“Transfer”** means, with respect to a Membership Interest or any interest therein, the sale, assignment, transfer, disposition, pledge, hypothecation or encumbrance thereof, whether direct or indirect, voluntary, involuntary or by operation of law, and whether or not for value, of (a) all or any part of that Membership Interest or interest therein or (b) a controlling interest in any Person which directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries holds that Membership Interest or interest therein.

22. **“Treasury Regulations”** means the regulations of the United States Treasury Department pertaining to the income tax.

23. **“Undeployed Capital”** means, with respect to a Member, (i) the amount of capital contributions made by such Member less (ii) (A) the amount of capital contributions made by such Member that have been invested in a DAO Investment or that have been committed to a DAO Investment that has been approved by the Members (i.e., if such DAO Investment has been approved by the Members and such capital contributions have not yet been paid over or transferred to facilitate a DAO Investment or an applicable Portfolio Project or seller, or used to pay expenses in connection with such DAO Investment), plus (B) the amount of capital contributions made by such Member that have been expended by the DAO to pay DAO Expenses, plus (C) the amount of capital contributions made by such Member that have been reserved to pay DAO Expenses.

    References in this Agreement to **“Articles,”** **“Sections,”** **“Exhibits,”** and **“Schedules,”** shall be to the Articles, Sections, Exhibits and Schedules of this Agreement, unless otherwise specifically provided; all Exhibits and Schedules to this Agreement are incorporated herein by reference; any of the terms defined in this Agreement may, unless the context otherwise requires, be used in the singular or the plural and in any gender depending on the reference; the words “herein,” “hereof,” and “hereunder” and words of similar import, when used in this Agreement, shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement; and except as otherwise specified in this Agreement, all references in this Agreement (a) to any Person shall be deemed to include such Person’s permitted successors and assigns; and (b) to any agreement, any document or any other written instrument shall be a reference to such agreement, document or instrument together with all exhibits, schedules, attachments and appendices thereto, and in each case as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time in accordance with the terms thereof; and (c) to any law, statute or regulation shall be deemed references to such law, statute or regulation as the same may be supplemented, amended, consolidated, superseded or modified from time to time.
