# S Corporation

According to the [U.S. Small Business Administration](https://www.sba.gov/business-guide/launch-your-business/choose-business-structure):

> An S corporation, sometimes called an S corp, is a special type of corporation that's designed to avoid the double taxation drawback of regular C corps. S corps allow profits, and some losses, to be passed through directly to owners' personal income without ever being subject to corporate tax rates.
>
> S corps must file with the IRS to get S corp status, a different process from registering with their state.

Filing as an S corporation can help to save on taxes, but there are [specific requirements](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/s-corporations) for operating as one. To be an S corporation, your business must:

- Be a domestic corporation
- Have only allowable shareholders
  > - May be individuals, certain trusts, and estates and
  > - May not be partnerships, corporations or non-resident alien shareholders
- Have no more than 100 shareholders
- Have only one class of stock
- Not be an ineligible corporation (i.e. certain financial institutions, insurance companies, and domestic international sales corporations).

S corporations also have unique filing requirements: to learn more, visit [irs.gov](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/s-corporations).
