Welcome to Stripe!

This Stripe Services Agreement includes this introduction, the General Terms, Definitions, Services Terms, and incorporated documents and terms (“**Agreement**”) and forms a legal agreement among Stripe Payments Europe, Limited (“**SPEL**”); Stripe Technology Europe, Limited (“**Stripe PSP**”); and the entity or sole proprietor on whose behalf a Stripe account is created (“**you**” and “**your**”) to receive certain payment processing, data, technology and analytics, or other business services offered by Stripe and its Affiliates. Stripe PSP is a party to this Agreement solely for the purposes of (a) providing Authorised Payment Services (as Section 5.3 of the General Terms describes); and (b) acting as a Payment Method Acquirer. Each reference in this Agreement to “**Stripe**” means SPEL, except to the extent that the reference relates to providing Authorised Payment Services, in which case “**Stripe**” means Stripe PSP. This Agreement states the terms and conditions that apply to your use of the Services.

This Agreement is effective upon the date you first access or use the Services (“**Effective Date**”) and continues until you or Stripe terminates it (this period, the “**Term**”). Capitalised terms used in this Agreement that are not defined inline are defined in the Definitions.

As referenced in Section 13 of the General Terms, any dispute between you and Stripe must be resolved by arbitration. Please read the arbitration provision in this Agreement as it affects your rights under this Agreement.

## General Terms

Last modified: November 17, 2022

You and Stripe agree as follows:

### 1\. Your Stripe Account.

#### 1.1 Eligibility.

Only businesses (including sole proprietors) and non-profit organisations located in Ireland are eligible to apply for a Stripe Account and use the Services. Stripe and its Affiliates may provide Services to you or your Affiliates in other countries or regions under separate agreements. You and your Representative must not attempt to create a Stripe Account on behalf of or for the benefit of a user whose use of the Stripe services was suspended or terminated by Stripe, unless Stripe approves otherwise.

#### 1.2 Business Representative.

You and your Representative individually affirm to Stripe that (a) your Representative is authorised to provide User Information on your behalf and to bind you to this Agreement; and (b) your Representative is an executive officer, director, senior manager or otherwise has significant responsibility for the control, management or direction of your business. Stripe may require you or your Representative to provide additional information or documentation demonstrating your Representative’s authority.

#### 1.3 Sole Proprietors.

If you are a sole proprietor, you and your Representative also affirm that your Representative is personally responsible and liable for your use of the Services and your obligations to Customers, including payment of amounts you owe under this Agreement.

#### 1.4 Age Requirements.

If you are a sole proprietor, and you are not old enough to enter into a contract on your own behalf (which is commonly but not always 18 years old), but you are 13 years old or older, your Representative must be your parent or legal guardian. If you are a legal entity that is owned, directly or indirectly, by an individual who is not old enough to enter into a contract on their own behalf, but the individual is 13 years old or older, your Representative must obtain the consent of either your board or an authorised officer. The approving board, authorised officer, parent or legal guardian is responsible to Stripe and is legally bound to this Agreement as if it had agreed to this Agreement itself. You must not use the Services if you are under 13 years of age.

### 2\. Services and Support.

#### 2.1 Services.

Stripe (and its Affiliates, as applicable) will make available to you the Services, including those described in the applicable Services Terms, and, if applicable, give you access to a Stripe Dashboard.

#### 2.2 Services Terms; Order of Precedence.

The Services Terms contain specific terms governing the parties’ rights and obligations related to the Services described in those Services Terms. If there are no Services Terms for a particular Stripe service, then only these General Terms govern. By accessing or using a Service, you agree to comply with the applicable Services Terms. If any term in these General Terms conflicts with a term in any Services Terms or set of terms incorporated by reference into this Agreement, then unless terms of lower precedence expressly state to the contrary, the order of precedence is: (a) the Services Terms; (b) these General Terms; and (c) all terms incorporated by reference into this Agreement. Your access to or use of the Services may also be subject to additional terms to which you agree through the Stripe Dashboard.

#### 2.3 Service Modifications and Updates.

Stripe may modify the Services and Stripe Technology at any time, including adding or removing functionality or imposing conditions on use of the Services. Stripe will notify you of material adverse changes in, deprecations to, or removal of functionality from, Services or Stripe Technology that you are using. Stripe is not obligated to provide any Updates. However, if Stripe makes an Update available, you must fully install the Update by the date or within the time period stated in Stripe’s notice; or, if there is no date or period stated in the notice, then no later than 30 days after the date of the notice.

#### 2.4 Subcontracting.

Stripe may subcontract its obligations under this Agreement to third parties.

#### 2.5 Services Restrictions.

You may only use the Services for business purposes. You must not, and must not enable or allow any third party to:

(a) use the Services for personal, family or household purposes;

(b) act as service bureau or pass-through agent for the Services with no added value to Customers;

(c) work around any of the technical limitations of the Services or enable functionality that is disabled or prohibited, or access or attempt to access non-public Stripe systems, programs, data, or services;

(d) except to the extent Law permits, reverse engineer or attempt to reverse engineer the Services or Stripe Technology(e) use the Services to engage in any activity that is illegal, fraudulent, deceptive or harmful;

(f) perform or attempt to perform any action that interferes with the normal operation of the Services or affects other Stripe users’ use of Stripe services; or

#### 2.6 Beta Services.

(a) _Classification_. Stripe may classify certain Stripe services or Stripe Technology, including a particular release or feature, as Beta. A Stripe service may be generally available in some circumstances (e.g., in some countries or regions) while still classified as Beta in other circumstances.

(b) _Nature of Beta Services_. By their nature, Beta Services may be feature-incomplete or contain bugs. Stripe may describe limitations that exist within a Beta Service; however, your reliance on the accuracy or completeness of these descriptions is at your own risk. You should not use Beta Services in a production environment until and unless you understand and accept the limitations and flaws that may be present in the Beta Services.

(c) _Feedback_. Unless Stripe otherwise agrees in writing, your use of Beta Services is confidential, and you must provide timely Feedback on the Beta Services in response to Stripe requests.  
(d) Availability During Beta Period. Stripe may suspend or terminate your access to any Beta Services at any time.

#### 2.7 Support.

Stripe will provide you with support to resolve general issues relating to your Stripe Account and your use of the Services through resources and documentation that Stripe makes available on the Stripe Website and in the Documentation. Stripe’s support is also available by contacting Stripe at [contact us](https://stripe.com/en-ie/contact). Stripe is not responsible for providing support to Customers.

#### 2.8 Third-Party Services.

Stripe may reference, enable you to access, or promote (including on the Stripe Website) Third-Party Services. These Third-Party Services are provided for your convenience only and Stripe does not approve, endorse, or recommend any Third-Party Services to you. **Your access and use of any Third-Party Service is at your own risk and Stripe disclaims all responsibility and liability for your use of any Third-Party Service. Third-Party Services are not Services and are not governed by this Agreement or Stripe’s Privacy Policy. Your use of any Third-Party Service, including those linked from the Stripe Website, is subject to that Third-Party Service’s own terms of use and privacy policies (if any).**

### 3\. Information; Your Business.

#### 3.1 User Information.

Upon Stripe’s request, you must provide User Information to Stripe in a form satisfactory to Stripe. You must keep the User Information in your Stripe Account current. You must promptly update your Stripe Account with any changes affecting you, the nature of your business activities, your Representative, beneficial owners, principals, or any other pertinent information. You must immediately notify Stripe, and provide to Stripe updated User Information, if (a) you experience or anticipate experiencing a Change of Control; (b) you experience or anticipate experiencing a material change in your business or financial condition, including if you experience or are likely to experience an Insolvency Proceeding; (c) the regulatory status of the business for which you are using the Services changes, including if it becomes subject, or no longer subject, to regulatory oversight; or (d) a Governmental Authority has notified you that you or your business is the subject of investigative action.

#### 3.2 Information Retrieved by Stripe.

You authorise Stripe to retrieve information about you and your business from Stripe’s service providers and other third parties, including credit reporting agencies, banking partners and information bureaus, and you authorise and direct those third parties to compile and provide that information to Stripe. This information may include your, or your Representative’s, name, addresses, credit history, banking relationships, and financial history.

### 4\. Services Fees; Taxes.

#### 4.1 Services Fees.

The Fees are stated on the Stripe Pricing Page, unless you and Stripe otherwise agree in writing. Stripe may revise the Fees at any time. If Stripe revises the Fees for a Service that you are currently using, Stripe will notify you at least 30 days (or a longer period if Law requires) before the revised Fees apply to you.

#### 4.2 Collection of Fees and Other Amounts.

You must pay, or ensure that Stripe is able to collect, Fees and other amounts you owe under this Agreement when due. Stripe may deduct, recoup or setoff Fees and other amounts you owe under this Agreement, or under any other agreements you have with Stripe or any of its Affiliates, from your Stripe Account balance, or invoice you for those amounts. If you fail to pay invoiced amounts when due, if your Stripe Account balance is negative or does not contain funds sufficient to pay amounts that you owe under this Agreement, or under any other agreement with Stripe or any of its Affiliates, or if Stripe is unable to collect amounts due from your Stripe Account balance, then Stripe may, to the extent Law permits, deduct, recoup or setoff those amounts from: (a) if established and applicable, each Reserve; (b) funds payable by Stripe or its Affiliate to you or your Affiliate; (c) if established, each User Affiliate Reserve; (d) each User Bank Account; and (e) the Stripe account balance of each Stripe account that Stripe determines, acting reasonably, is associated with you or your Affiliate. If the currency of the amount being deducted is different from the currency of the amount you owe, Stripe may deduct, recoup or setoff an amount equal to the amount owed (using Stripe’s conversion rate) together with any fees Stripe incurs in making the conversion.

Without limiting Section 4.2 of these General Terms, you authorise Stripe to debit each User Bank Account without separate notice, and according to the applicable [User Bank Account Debit Authorisation](https://stripe.com/en-ie/legal/bank-debit-authorizations), to collect amounts you owe under this Agreement. If Stripe is unable to collect those amounts by debiting a User Bank Account, then you immediately grant to Stripe a new, original authorisation to debit each User Bank Account without notice and according to the applicable [User Bank Account Debit Authorisation](https://stripe.com/en-ie/legal/bank-debit-authorizations). Stripe may rely on this authorisation to make one or more attempts to collect all or a subset of the amounts owed. Your authorisation under this Section 4.3 will remain in full force and effect until (a) all of your Stripe Accounts are closed; or (b) all fees and other amounts you owe under this Agreement are paid, whichever occurs later. If applicable debit scheme authorisation rules grant you the right to revoke your debit authorisation, then to the extent Law permits, you waive that right.

#### 4.4 Taxes.

Stripe’s fees exclude all Taxes, except as the Stripe Pricing Page states to the contrary. You have sole responsibility and liability for:

(a) determining which, if any, Taxes or fees apply to the sale of your products and services, acceptance of donations, or payments you make or receive in connection with your use of the Services; and

(b) assessing, collecting, reporting and remitting Taxes for your business. If Stripe is required to withhold any Taxes, Stripe may deduct those Taxes from amounts otherwise owed to you and pay those Taxes to the appropriate taxing authority. If you are exempt from paying, or are otherwise eligible to pay a reduced rate on, those Taxes, you may provide to Stripe an original certificate that satisfies applicable legal requirements attesting to your tax-exempt status or reduced rate eligibility, in which case Stripe will not deduct the Taxes covered by the certificate. You must provide accurate information regarding your tax affairs as Stripe reasonably requests, and must promptly notify Stripe if any information that Stripe prepopulates is inaccurate or incomplete. Stripe may send documents to you and taxing authorities for transactions processed using the Services. Specifically, Law may require Stripe to file periodic informational returns with taxing authorities related to your use of the Services. Stripe may send tax-related information electronically to you.

### 5\. User Bank Accounts; Funds.

#### 5.1 User Bank Accounts; Prohibition on Grant or Assignment.

You must designate at least one User Bank Account in connection with the Services. Stripe may debit and credit a User Bank Account as described in this Agreement. You must not grant or assign to any third party any lien on or interest in funds that may be owed to you under this Agreement until the funds are deposited into a User Bank Account.

#### 5.2 Investment of Funds.

To the extent Law and the applicable Financial Services Terms permit, Stripe may invest the funds that it holds into liquid investments. Stripe owns the earnings from these investments. You irrevocably assign to Stripe all rights you have (if any) to earnings from these investments.

#### 5.3 Authorised Payment Services.

Stripe Technology Europe, Limited ("**Stripe PSP**") is regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland. The Central Bank of Ireland has authorised Stripe PSP as an electronic money institution under reference number C187865. Stripe PSP does not offer any form of deposit or savings account. Stripe PSP is not part of the Financial Services Compensation Scheme or the Deposit Guarantee Scheme. To the extent the Services are Authorised Payment Services, Stripe PSP is the only provider of those Services. As the provider of Authorised Payment Services, Stripe PSP will be the only Stripe party liable to you for collecting payment proceeds from Transactions on your behalf, safeguarding those proceeds, and settling those proceeds to your User Bank Account or as you otherwise direct. Stripe is not a bank, and does not accept deposits.

#### 5.4 E-Money Services; Using a Third-Party Payment Services Provider.

(a) _E-money Services_. Depending on your location and, if applicable, your Connected Accounts’ location, Stripe may offer E-money Services to you. The terms in this Section 5.4 only apply if Stripe provides E-money Services to you. You may use the Services to purchase E-money from Stripe, to send and receive E-money, and, if applicable, to transfer E-money to Connected Accounts. You will not receive any earnings from E-money that Stripe issues or holds. If Stripe holds E-money for you, Stripe will safeguard that E-money according to Law. You may use the Stripe Technology to redeem E-money Stripe holds for you for par value, and Stripe will settle funds to the User Bank Account according to the Payout Schedule.

(b) _Using a Third-Party Payment Service Provider (TPP)_. If Stripe provides a Payment Account to you, you may enable a TPP to access information regarding that Payment Account or make payments from the Payment Account according to Law. You must ensure that each TPP you use (if any) is authorised or registered with the applicable Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, as among the parties, you are liable for the TPP’s acts and omissions. If necessary to allow the TPP to access your Payment Account, you may provide your Stripe Account credentials to the TPP. Stripe may refuse to allow any TPP to access information regarding your Payment Account if Stripe reasonably believes that the TPP’s actions are unauthorised, fraudulent or illegal. Unless Law prohibits notification, Stripe will notify you if Stripe takes this action. You must notify Stripe immediately if you believe a payment made through a TPP was unauthorised or incorrect.

### 6\. Termination; Suspension; Survival.

(a) _Your Termination_. You may terminate this Agreement at any time by closing your Stripe Account. To do so, [you must open the account information tab in your account settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/login?redirect=%2Faccount&__previewId=), select “close my account” and stop using the Services. If after termination you use the Services again, this Agreement will apply with an Effective Date that is the date on which you first use the Services again.

(b) _Stripe Termination_. Stripe may terminate this Agreement (or any part) or close your Stripe Account at any time for any or no reason (including if any event listed in Sections 6.2(a)–(i) of these General Terms occurs) by notifying you.
