This page contains various organizational calculator tools which have been used for small projects and billion-dollar valuation public companies alike; they have been made available for projects employing the Juicebox Protocol.

- The [Headcount Calculator](/legal/calculators/Headcount-Calculator.xlsx) forecasts employee/contractor headcount and salary expenses as your entity grows.
- The [Capitalization Forecast Calculator](/legal/calculators/Stock-Allocation-Capitalization.xlsx) (commonly called a "cap table") can be used to forecast equity capitalization over time.

### Headcount Calculator

### Capitalization Calculator

Also referred to as the so-called "cap-table", this is the cornerstone to any startup and best friend to any founder with the intention to maintain control or have any semblance of fundraising/compesation forecasting. This spreadsheet accomplishes the exact activity and purpose as paid commercial software solutions such as [LTSE Equity](https://equity.ltse.com/features), (less some wizard modals and pretty layouts) with due effort to make the layout non-atrocious. This very spreadsheet has faciliated over $100m in pre-seed, seed, option, and Series A securities sales.
