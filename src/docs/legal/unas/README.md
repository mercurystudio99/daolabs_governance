The legal ramifications of Unincorporated Nonprofit Associations (UNAs) differ slightly from state to state. Resources on this website are written with regards to Nevada and Delaware UNAs. As always, do your own research, speak to legal experts, and check your state's laws.

According to [Nevada Statutes](https://www.leg.state.nv.us/nrs/nrs-081.html#NRS081Sec700), an "Unincorporated Nonprofit Association" (or "UNA") is an unincorporated organization consisting of two or more members joined under an agreement that is oral, in a record or implied from conduct, for one or more common nonprofit purposes.

- An UNA _may_ distribute funds so long as those distributions are in furtherance of its non-profit purposes.
- An UNA is a legal entity distinct from its members and managers—UNAs can hold property, debts, liabilities, and may sue or be sued.
- UNAs are formed by an agreement between their members, and do not typically need to file incorporating documents with any state authorities.
- UNAs can operate as a tax-exempt nonprofit if the purpose of its activity is of public benefit, and its annual revenues are less than $5,000. UNAs may also apply for 501(c)(3) status.
- UNAs may invoke a tax liability.

Whether you know this or not, most informal groups are effectively "unincorporated associations". Common examples include neighborhood watches, groups pooling funds for non-profit reasons, and little league or similar teams. Simply by association, an entity is formed.

The U.S. government frequently charges individuals for 18 U.S. Code 371, or conspiracy: _"two or more persons conspir[ing] either to commit any offense against the United States"._ Simply put: individuals associated with each other for an unlawful purpose.

#### For Your Project

Unincorporated Nonprofit Associations work best for projects with token-based membership and governance. You may want to utilize an UNA if you're forming a non-profit DAO, a charity, or any project with a public good or non-profit purpose.

- Projects with off-chain governance (such as Snapshot) may be able to use a [Nevada Unincorporated Nonprofit Association Agreement](/legal/unas/nevada.md).
- Projects with on-chain governance may be able to use a [Delaware Unincorporated Nonprofit Association Agreement](/legal/unas/delaware.md).
