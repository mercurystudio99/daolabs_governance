<p align="center">[Project-name] GUIDING PRINCIPLES</p>

These guiding principles (the "Agreement") are entered into by and amongst members of [Project-name], an unincorporated nonprofit association organized under the laws of the State of Delaware ([Project-name]). This Agreement provides the terms of Membership and governance for DAO, and the agreement between each Member of the DAO. The following terms apply when you click to view or access [Project-name]'s Dapp or [Project-name]'s other online services, contribute to [Project-name], become a Member of [Project-name], receive [Project-name] Tokens, hold Governance Rights for [Project-name], interact with or access [Project-name]'s smart contracts in any way, provide services to [Project-name], or otherwise interact with or access [Project-name]'s services through the Dapp. By doing any of the above, you signify your agreement to these terms. If you do not agree to be bound by the Agreement in its entirety, you may not access, interact with, or use [Project-name]. Capitalized terms used herein have the meanings ascribed to them in Section 17.

## 1. Organization.

(a) Formation. [Project-name] was formed on [Project-formation-date] under the laws of the State of Delaware. The obligations of members of the [Project-name] shall be determined pursuant to the Delaware Uniform Unincorporated Nonprofit Association Act, Del. Code Ann. Tit. 6, §§ 1901-1916 inclusive (the “Act”), and this Agreement.

(b) Purpose. The primary purpose of the [Project-name] is to [Purpose]. [Project-name] shall have the power to do any and all acts appropriate, convenient, desirable, incidental, or necessary to or in furtherance of the purposes described in this Agreement, including, without limitation, any and all of the powers that may be exercised on behalf of [Project-name] by its members. [Project-name] shall operate solely within the scope of nonprofit and charitable purposes and shall not engage in profit-making activities. Any profits that are incidentally accrued or earned from any of [Project-name]'s activities will be used or set aside for [Project-name]'s nonprofit purposes.

[Project-name] is not intended to be or become an entity required to register as an “investment company” as defined in Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

## 2. Membership.

(a) Admission of Members. On [Initial-contribution-date], all of [Project-name]’s initial contributors (“Members”) had their membership granted upon confirmation of the contribution they made to [Project-name]’s Gnosis Multi-Signature Wallet (Ethereum Mainnet) [Gnosis-Ethereum-address].
[Project-name] is authorized to accept additional donations from one or more Members, and to admit other non-Members to [Project-name] as additional Members. Unless otherwise determined by the Members, any such non-Member shall be admitted to [Project-name] and receive Governance Rights only if such non-Member makes a contribution to [Project-name]’s Gnosis Multi-Signature Wallet (Ethereum Mainnet) [Gnosis-Ethereum-address] or acquires the [Project-name] token ([Project-token]) from an existing Member or third-party. Each person who is to be admitted as an additional Member pursuant to this Agreement shall agree to be bound by this Agreement. [Project-name] will consistently review admissions, and if necessary, Members may adjust the [Project-name] admission requirements based on their evolving needs, as long as new admission requirements are agreed upon through the DAO’s Governance Process.

(b) Transfers. Governance Rights and [Project-token] are freely transferable, both to other Members and to non-Members (Ethereum addresses outside of the DAO ("External Addresses")). As previously stated, External Addresses, or non-Members, who hold any [Project-token] shall automatically be granted Membership rights and agree to be subject to this Agreement. Members may vote to allow or disallow the ability of Members to transfer their Governance Rights and/or [Project-token] by a vote facilitated via the DAO’s Governance Process.

Upon the death, incompetence, bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, or dissolution of a Member, the rights and obligations of that Member under this Agreement shall accrue to that Member’s successor(s), estate, or legal representative, and each such Person shall be treated as an unadmitted transferee of that Member’s [Project-token], as described in the Act.

(c) Responsibilities. As of the date hereof, Members are not required to submit to any dues or membership fees. However, in the event the Members agree otherwise via a vote occurring through Governance Process, each Member shall keep reasonably current in payment of any dues or membership fees and other financial obligations of membership, if applicable and determined by [Project-name]. Each Member shall notify [Project-name] via Discord, Twitter, or any other acceptable communication channel approved by [Project-name] by which that Member may receive written or electronic materials required or permitted by this document or shall notify [Project-name] that such Member lacks the standard acceptable addresses and designate a mutually acceptable form of communication.
Members agree to follow the [Project-conduct-guidelines] in regard to their behavior and participation in the community and be subject to consequences that may be enforced in the case of a violation of the [Project-conduct-guidelines].

If you have received any [Project-token] or are otherwise a Member, you consent and agree to become legally bound by this Agreement as both a participant in [Project-name] and more specifically a [Project-name] Member.

(d) Information Rights. Members can access information concerning operational and financial transactions of [Project-name] via

- The Gnosis Multi-Signature Wallet, [Gnosis-Ethereum-address]
- Etherscan and other Ethereum Block Explorers, https://etherscan.io/address/[Gnosis-Ethereum-address], and
- Governance Process https://snapshot.org/#/[Project-ENS].

Otherwise, [Project-name] is not required to keep any records concerning legal, accounting, or other affairs, and aside from the above public information. Furthermore, [Project-name] shall not be required to maintain any additional records. Notwithstanding the foregoing, [Project-name] may engage with third parties to provide legal services, accounting services, and any record-keeping in order to comply with any legal obligations that [Project-name] or its agents may have.

(e) No Member Liability. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or the Act, no Member (or former Member) shall be personally liable for the obligations of the DAO, including any obligations owed by any individual Member in connection with any breach of this Agreement. A debt, obligation, or other liability of the DAO is solely the debt, obligation, or other liability of the DAO. Members (or former Members) are not personally liable, directly or indirectly, by way of contribution or otherwise, for a debt, obligation, or other liability of the DAO solely by reason of being or acting as a Member or acting on behalf of the DAO. The failure of the DAO to observe formalities relating to the exercise of its powers or management of its activities and affairs is not grounds for imposing liability on a Member of the DAO for a debt, obligation, or other liability of the DAO.

(f) No Derivative Actions. No Member shall have the right to bring any action or proceeding in any court or before any arbitrator or other tribunal against the DAO or any other Member on account of any alleged or actual breach of this Agreement or any other agreement or instrument to which the DAO is a party or by which it is bound, or for any other purpose whatsoever, except as expressly provided in this Agreement.

(g) Member Limitations. No Member shall have the right or power: (i) to cause the dissolution and winding up of the DAO; or (ii) to demand or receive property or assets, including any Cryptographic Currency or ERC-20 or ERC-721 Tokens (“Cryptocurrency Assets”) contributed or otherwise transferred to the DAO, except as agreed to by the Members or otherwise provided herein.

(h) Waiver of Fiduciary Duties. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or otherwise of applicable law, including any in equity or at law, no Member shall have any fiduciary duty to the DAO or to any Member by reason of this Agreement or in its capacity as a Member, including, but not limited to, the duties of due care and loyalty, whether those duties were established as of the date of this Agreement or any time hereafter, and whether established under common law, at equity or legislatively defined, except that the Members shall be subject to the implied contractual covenant of good faith and fair dealing and the terms and provisions of this Agreement. The provisions of this Agreement, to the extent that they restrict or eliminate the duties and liabilities of the Members otherwise existing at law or in equity, are agreed by the parties hereto to replace such other duties and liabilities of the Members. Members will exercise any rights under this Agreement consistent with this Agreement.

(i) Limitation by Law. No provision of this Agreement shall be construed to provide for the indemnification for any liability to the extent (but only to the extent) that such indemnification would be in violation of applicable law, but instead shall be construed so as to effectuate the provisions thereof to the fullest extent permitted by law.

(j) Except as expressly set forth in this Section, in the event that any Member initiates any Proceeding against the DAO, and a judgment or order not subject to further appeal or discretionary review is rendered, that Member shall be solely liable for all costs and expenses related to the Proceeding and/or judgment or order from the Proceeding.

## 3. Management.

(a) Except as otherwise expressly required in this Agreement, the affairs of the DAO shall be carried on and managed exclusively by the Members, who shall have sole and absolute discretion with respect thereto. No Member shall be a manager, as defined under the Act.

(b) [Project-name] follows a proposal process to allow community Members to propose and vote on all actions of [Project-name]. Whenever any action, including any approval, consent, decision, determination, or resolution is to be taken or given by the Members or the DAO under this Agreement or under the Act, it shall be authorized by a Majority Vote of the Members via the DAO’s Governance Process, unless otherwise provided herein. Such an authorization may be evidenced by a vote facilitated via the DAO’s Governance Process and one or more smart contracts, or by a written consent, in accordance with this Agreement. The Members intend that any action (which has been duly approved in accordance with this Agreement) taken by the DAO via the DAO’s Governance Process shall be a valid action of the Members or the DAO, as applicable, and no Member shall challenge the authority or validity of any such action based solely on such fact.

(c) Except as otherwise expressly required in this Agreement or in the Act, no single Member (in their capacity as a Member) shall have authority to bind the DAO in any way or to enter into any agreement or contract obligating the DAO in any way unless approved via a vote occurring through the DAO’s Governance Process.

(d) To the extent that the Members have approved a document in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Act, any Member can be expressly hereby authorized to execute and deliver such document on behalf of the DAO.

(e) Members may appoint a proxy to vote or otherwise act for the Member with regards to the DAO pursuant to the DAO’s Governance Process.

(f) The DAO has the right to delegate certain technical or administrative responsibilities to third parties and provide them with reasonable compensation.

(g) Reliance by Third Parties. Persons dealing with the DAO are entitled to rely conclusively upon the power and authority of the Members (and any Person to whom the Members delegated any such power and authority pursuant to this Agreement).

(h) Other Activities. Each Member acknowledges and agrees that in addition to transactions specifically contemplated by this Agreement, and subject to applicable law, the Members, the DAO, and their respective Affiliates and Representatives are each hereby authorized to obtain property or obtain services from, to provide property or provide services to, or otherwise enter into any transaction with any Member, or any Affiliate or Representative of any of the foregoing Persons. 3. Governance Rights and Tokens.

(a) Governance Rights. Each Member’s Governance Rights and voting power in the DAO is represented by [Project-token], with each Project Token representing a fractional part of the Governance Rights of all Members (or assignees, as the case may be) equal to the quotient of one (1) divided by the total number of Tokens in circulation.

(b) Project Tokens. As of the date hereof, there shall be [Total-token-supply] Tokens authorized to represent membership interests in the DAO.

(c) Token Liquidity Pools. The DAO shall not create any liquidity pools for the [Project-token], or any other tokens associated with the DAO.

(d) Governance Rights and Token Limitations. Governance Rights and the [Project-name TOKEN] provide no possibility of profits and losses, no rights to distributions and dividends, and no rights to ownership or management of [Project-name]. Each Member (or assign, as the case may be) that receives or holds [Project-name TOKEN] expressly and unequivocally agrees that the [Project-name TOKEN] provide no rights to profits and/or losses, do not entitle the holder to distributions or dividends, and do not make the holder an owner or manager of [Project-name].

## 4. Withdrawal Rights; Compulsory Withdrawal.

(a) Limited Right to Withdraw. A Member may withdraw their membership at any time by transferring its Tokens to a third party. Such withdrawal shall be facilitated and executed, in part, using one or more smart contracts and shall be effective as of the date of transfer. Any withdrawal is irrevocable.

(b) Compulsory Withdrawal. Not in limitation of Section 6(a), the Members acting by vote via the DAO’s Governance Process may cause a Member to be compulsorily withdrawn from the [Project-name] to the extent that such Members, in their reasonable discretion, determine it to be necessary, desirable, or appropriate, including, without limitation, to comply with applicable law or regulations, or to avoid a material adverse effect on the [Project-name] or the other Members. For the avoidance of doubt–the Member proposed to be compulsorily withdrawn shall be entitled to vote with respect to any vote of the Members regarding such compulsory withdrawal.

## 5. Fees and Expenses.

(a) Organizational Expenses. The [Project-name] shall bear all of its organizational expenses and costs and may amortize these expenses for accounting and/or tax purposes.

(ii) [Project-name] Expenses shall be allocated to and funded by the [Project-name].

## 6. Distributions; Dividends; Compensation.

## 7. Dissolution.

(a) General. The [Project-name] shall be dissolved and its affairs shall be wound up upon the earliest to occur of: (i) a determination of the Members by Majority Vote via the DAO’s Governance Process; or (ii) the entry of a decree of judicial dissolution pursuant to the Act.

[Project-name] shall have the right to provide the Service Provider with reasonable compensation.

Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, any Service Provider of [Project-name] shall not be liable for any error of judgment, mistake of law, or for any loss suffered by the [Project-name], its Members, Persons affiliated with the [Project-name] or its Members, or third parties in connection with the matters to which this Agreement relates or for any services provided by the Service Provider, except for a loss resulting from the Service Provider's willful misfeasance, gross negligence, or reckless disregard in the performance of its duties under this Agreement. Furthermore, the Service Provider shall not be liable for: (i) any action taken or omitted in accordance with or in reliance upon written or oral instructions, advice, data, documents, or information (without investigation or verification) received by the Service Provider from any Person; (ii) any liability arising from the transfer or use of any Governance Rights or Tokens, including with respect to matters arising under applicable laws or private rights of action; or (iii) any action taken or omitted by the [Project-name], its Members, any affiliated Persons of the [Project-name] or its Members, or any third party.

## 10. General Provisions.

(a) Notices. All notices required to be delivered under this Agreement shall be effective only if sent by electronic mail or other form of electronic communication through the Dapp. In computing the period of time for the giving of any notice, the day on which the notice is given shall be excluded, and the day on which the matter noticed is to occur shall be included. If notice is given by electronic means, it shall be deemed given when sent; provided, that the sending party does not have reason to believe that such notice was not delivered.

(b) Further Assurance. Each Member agrees to perform all further acts and to execute, acknowledge, and deliver any document (including tax forms and information) that may reasonably be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Agreement.

Notwithstanding the place where this Agreement may be executed by any of the parties hereto, the parties expressly agree that all of the terms and provisions hereof shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to the principles of choice or conflicts of laws thereof that would require that this Agreement be governed by the laws of another state. Each of the parties hereto consents and agrees to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in Delaware, and waives any objection based on venue or forum non conveniens with respect to any action instituted therein and agrees that any dispute concerning the conduct of any party in connection with this Agreement shall be heard only in the courts described above.
