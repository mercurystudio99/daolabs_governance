6.4 **Malicious Code**. Licensor shall use industry best practices and take prudent actions and precautions to identify, screen and prevent the introduction and proliferation of, any Malicious Code into Licensee's environment or any system used by Licensor. Without limiting Licensor's other obligations under the Agreement, Licensor covenants that, in the event any Malicious Code is found in its software or systems, Licensor shall promptly notify Licensee in writing of the Malicious Code and shall at no additional charge promptly eliminate, and reduce the effects of the Malicious Code and, if the Malicious Code causes a loss of operational efficiency, loss of data or results in stolen or unauthorized access to Licensee Information, use diligent efforts to mitigate the effects of such losses and unauthorized access and restore any lost data using generally accepted data restoration techniques. Licensor shall indemnify Licensee for all losses incurred by Licensee as a result of such Malicious Code; provided, however, that such obligation will not be applicable with respect to Malicious Code that Licensor demonstrates was introduced by Licensee, its employees, agents or contractors. Licensor will cooperate with and assist Licensee to facilitate any required reporting related to any such loss of or stolen data or unauthorized access.

6.5 **Public Software**. Licensor shall notify Licensee of any Public Software components that are part of any Licensed Products as of the Effective Date.

In the event that the Licensed Software (as it is currently configured and as it may be configured in the future) includes or is distributed with any Public Software, Licensor represents and warrants that (a) there are no provisions in any licenses covering the Public Software that would require the disclosure of any software or other technology of Licensee, its affiliates or contractors, and (b) to the extent that any such disclosure provisions become applicable to any Public Software included in or distributed with the Licensed Products in the future, Licensee's (and its Affiliates's) use of the Licensed Products under this Agreement will not require such a disclosure.

6.6 **Disclaimer**. EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES STATED IN THIS **Agreement**, neither party MAKES ANY ADDITIONAL REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED (EITHER IN FACT OR BY OPERATION OF LAW), OR STATUTORY, AS TO ANY MATTER WHATSOEVER.

## 7. LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY.

7.1 **Disclaimer of Consequential Damages**. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARTY WILL, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY, LICENSEE'S SUBLICENSEES, OR ANY END-USERS FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOST PROFITS OR LOSS OF BUSINESS, EVEN IF APPRISED OF THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7.2 **Independent Allocations of Risk**. EACH PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS TO ALLOCATE THE RISKS OF THIS AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES. THIS ALLOCATION IS REFLECTED IN THE PRICING OFFERED BY Licensor TO LICENSEE AND IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, AND EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS WILL APPLY EVEN IF THE WARRANTIES IN THIS AGREEMENT HAVE FAILED OF THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

## 8. CONFIDENTIALITY.

8.1 "**Confidential Information**" means the trade secrets of each party, and any other information disclosed by either party to the other party during the Term, or otherwise in connection with the Agreement, that the other party knows or has reason to know is confidential, whether such information is of a technical, business, or other nature (including, without limitation, information relating to such party's technology, software, products, services, designs, methodologies, business plans, finances, marketing plans, licensees, prospects, or other affairs). For purposes of clarity, the Licensed Products and Documentation are the Confidential Information of Licensor. Confidential Information does not include any information that, as evidenced by the recipient's written records:  was known to recipient prior to receiving the same from the discloser;  is independently developed by the recipient without use of or reference to information of the discloser; or is or becomes part of the public domain through no fault or action of the recipient.

8.2 **Restricted Use and Nondisclosure**. During and after the Term, the recipient shall:  use the discloser's Confidential Information solely for the purpose for which it is provided (and if no purpose is specified, then solely to perform its obligations or exercise its rights under this Agreement);  not disclose the discloser's Confidential Information to any third party other than as expressly provided for under this Agreement; and  protect the discloser's Confidential Information from unauthorized use and disclosure to the same extent (but using no less than a reasonable degree of care) that it protects its own Confidential Information of a similar nature.

8.3 **Required Disclosure**. If either party is required by law to disclose the other party's Confidential Information or the terms of this Agreement, it must give prompt written notice of such requirement before such disclosure and assist the other party in obtaining an order protecting the Confidential Information from disclosure.

8.4 **Return or Destruction** **of Materials**. Upon the termination of this Agreement (as more particularly set forth in **Section 5**), or upon earlier request, each party shall deliver to the other party or destroy all of the other party's Confidential Information that it may have in its possession or control.

## 9. GENERAL.

9.1 **Relationship**. Each party hereto shall be and act as an independent contractor (and not as the agent or representative of the other) in the performance of this Agreement. This Agreement shall not be interpreted or construed as  creating or evidencing any association, joint venture, partnership, or franchise between the parties;  imposing any partnership or franchise obligation or liability on either party; or  prohibiting or restricting Licensor's work with or performance of any services for any third party. Licensee must not represent to anyone that Licensee is an agent of Licensor or is otherwise authorized to bind or commit Licensor in any way without Licensor's prior written consent.

9.2 **Assignability**. Licensee may not assign its rights, duties, or obligations under this Agreement without Licensor's prior written consent except to 1) an Affiliate, or 2) a third party in connection with the transfer of Licensee's video on demand project presently referred to as "MovieBeam". If consent is given, this Agreement shall bind Licensee's successors and assigns. Any attempt by Licensee to transfer its rights, duties, or obligations under this Agreement, including in connection with a change of control of Licensee, except as expressly provided in this Agreement is void and is a material breach of this Agreement.

9.3 **Nonsolicitation**. During the Term and for a period of one year thereafter, neither party shall, directly or indirectly, employ or solicit the employment or services of an employee or independent contractor of the other party without the other party's prior written consent.

Either party may change its address for receipt of notice by notice to the other party in accordance with this Section.

9.5 **Force Majeure**. Neither party shall be liable for, or be considered to be in breach of or default under this Agreement on account of, any delay or failure to perform as required by this Agreement as a result of any cause or condition beyond its reasonable control, so long as such party uses all commercially reasonable efforts to avoid or remove such causes of non-performance.

9.6 **Governing Law**. This Agreement shall be interpreted, construed, and enforced in all respects in accordance with the laws of the State of Alabama, U.S.A, without reference to its choice of law rules and not including the provisions of the 1980 U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. Except as specified in **Section 9.7**, any action arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be heard in the federal, state, or local courts in the county of Houston, Alabama, and each party hereby irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of these courts.

9.7 **Arbitration**. Except for the right of either party to apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for a temporary restraining order, a preliminary injunction, or other equitable relief to preserve the status quo or prevent irreparable harm, any dispute as to the interpretation, enforcement, breach, or termination of this Agreement shall be settled by binding arbitration in Houston, Alabama, U.S.A under the Rules of the International Chamber of Commerce by three arbitrators appointed in accordance with those rules. All other disputes shall be resolved by a court specified in **Section 9.6**. Judgment upon an award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The prevailing party shall be entitled to receive from the other party its attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with any arbitration and/or litigation.

9.8 **Foreign Corrupt Practices Act**.

**1. Purpose**

The purpose of the SOW is to define and estimate the work involved in the phase 1 integration of the Licensor Cypher Solution into the MovieBeam system.

**2. General Description / Overview**

The first phase of the integration shall involve the integration of the Cypher System into the MovieBeam system to create and manage the entitlements for already encrypted files. The Licensor solution shall handle the key management for the new deployed receiving devices (G2.5) as well as the existing G2.0 receiving devices.

The high level block diagram and the high level message flow are shown in the figure below (NOTE: The block diagram should include an interface to the existing G2.0 STBs):

![](media/image4.wmf)

The integration shall support the following actions/tasks:

1.  The MovieBeam system middleware shall call an API in the Cypher Licensor system to add the Asset ID and the associated key for the asset into the database of the Cypher System.

2.  The MovieBeam system middleware shall call an API in the Cypher Licensor system to add all the subscribers and receiving devices into the database of the Cypher System.

3.  The Licensor Cypher system shall create an entitlement (EMM) for each subscriber for each asset.

4.  Every receiving device shall connect on a predefined interval to the Licensor Cypher EMMg server to retrieve its entitlements for all the assets.

5.  During operation the MovieBeam system middleware shall call an API in the Licensor Cypher system for sending EMM commands to the receiving devices.

6.  The Licensor EMMg server shall connect to the SkyStream MUX using the Simulcrypt specification and then insert the EMM control commands into the live over the air broadcast.

7.  The Licensor Cypher Client shall pass all received EMM control commands to the MovieBeam receiving device middleware.

8.  On the purchase of a Movie on the receiving device the credit limit shall be deducted with the value associated to the Movie.

9.  On the reaching of a specific pre-defined available credit value or when it receives an EMM control message the Cypher Client shall connection to the Cypher System to report the purchases made by the user.

10. Integration with the MovieBeam G2 set top box and integration with the hosted service as configured as of the Effective Date of this Agreement.

**3. Development Tasks**

The following development tasks are required for the project:

1.  API for adding encrypted assets

Develop a new Cypher Asset Owner interface message that can be used to define a new asset in the Cypher system by supplying the KeyId and Key associated to an already encrypted asset.

2.  EMM CMD (IRD commands) APIs

Develop a new Cypher Subscriber Owner interface messages to allow for EMM CMD messages to be transmitted over the air to the receiving devices and also for the Cypher Client to pass it back to the Middleware on the receiving device.

3.  Offline Credit Limit implementation

Develop a pay per view implementation that implements a credit limit that will allow a user to purchase content offline and also to report the purchases back to the Licensor Cypher system.

4.  STB Integration

Integrate the Licensor Cypher Client (virtual smart card) into the MovieBeam receiving devices. This will include the porting the Licensor Cypher Client to the Sigma 8634 XPU.

5.  EMM insertion

Develop the interface that can be used to insert EMMs into the live transmission MUX equipment for the live over the air broadcast of EMMs.

6.  MS ASF Decryption

The files will still be encrypted on the Head-End using the current MovieBeam system. The MS ASF decryption on the new receiving devices will have to be developed and implemented by Licensor.

7.  Licensor CAS Console (EIM Manager)

Develop support for the new EMM CMD messages in the Licensor CAS Console.

8.  Receiving Device Authentication/Provisioning (Chain of Trust)

Develop an Authentication/Provisioning (Chain of Trust) process for the new MovieBeam receiving device.

9.  Application Signing

Develop an application signing process for applications targeted for the new MovieBeam receiving device. . This process covers the complete trusted chain boot sequence starting from power on.

10. Virtual Smart Card Protection

For 8634 based implementations, the secure store will involve the XPU. For 8622 and 8634 based implementations, the Licensor solution will include protection against hard disk state rollback.

11. Secure Storage Add-ons

Develop APIs that allow MovieBeam to add items to the secure store. For example, rental pricing.

**4. Deliverables**

**_4.1 Deliverables from MovieBeam to Licensor_**

1.  Proxy Server command parameters specification associated to the already encrypted assets.

2.  EMM Command Specification.

3.  SkyStream MUX interface Specification.

## 5. Risks / Concerns

---

\# Risk Probability Impact Mitigation

---

1 Late availability of a development reference platform for the new receiving device G2.5 Unknown (we have not discussed status of the G2.5 with MovieBeam) High: The integration of the Cypher Client on the receiving device is a major part of the work and receiving it late shall impact the delivery date of April 2007. Keep in close contact with MovieBeam on the delivery and status of the new development reference platform.

2 Longer implementation time required for the offline Credit Limit implementation Low High: The offline credit limit implementation is key to the MovieBeam solution Additional resources may be added to project if required

3 Difficulty in supporting a proprietary format (Windows Media) Medium Medium: Most open video products have been built around an MPEG2TS and not a Windows ASF. This could limit the flexibility of future business models and device support. Most of the market has chosen H.264 over VC-1 even MS has de-prioritized internal codec efforts Consider conversion to H.264 w/MPEG2TS sooner rather then later.
