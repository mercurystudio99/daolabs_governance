Whether your Juicebox treasury requires a formal legal structure, a collection of written agreements, or remains unincorporated is ultimately up to you. This page describes how legal frameworks may be employed for Juicebox projects with for-profit purposes. _As a reminder, this documentation, the Juicebox Discord server, and the Juicebox Docs are not replacements for legal, tax, or accounting advice. Please do your own research._

### Limited Liability Company (LLC)

According to the [U.S. Small Business Administration](https://www.sba.gov/business-guide/launch-your-business/choose-business-structure):

> _LLCs protect you from personal liability in most instances, your personal assets — like your vehicle, house, and savings accounts — won't be at risk in case your LLC faces bankruptcy or lawsuits._
>
> _Profits and losses can get passed through to your personal income without facing corporate taxes. However, members of an LLC are considered self-employed and must pay self-employment tax contributions towards Medicare and Social Security._

- LLCs must be filed with state authorities.
- Depending on elections made by the LLC and the number of members, the IRS will treat an LLC as either a corporation, a partnership, or as part of the LLC’s owner’s tax return (a “disregarded entity”).
- Most states do not restrict ownership, so members may include individuals, corporations, other LLCs and foreign entities. Most states also permit “single-member” LLCs (those having only one owner).

#### For Your Project

LLCs are useful for separating personal debts and assets from business debts and assets. This makes LLCs an attractive option for investment clubs, or for projects purchasing real estate or other property.

##### Washington LLC

These documents will help you to form a standard Washington LLC.

- The [Operating Agreement](/legal/llcs/washington/operating-agreement.md) establishes a Washington LLC with sensible operating principles.
- The [New Member Signature Page](/legal/llcs/washington/new-member.md) adds a member to your Washington LLC.
- The [Joint Consent/Capitalization](/legal/llcs/washington/capitalization.md) document allows a sole director undertake several tasks, including the sale and issuance of common stock and to authorize officers of the LLC to take certain actions.
- The [Articles of Amendment](/legal/llcs/washington/amendment.md) allow your LLC to issue shares, and should be filed as Exhibit A of the Joint Consent document mentioned above.

##### Delaware Investment Club LLC

These documents have been adapted from [Syndicate](https://syndicate.io)'s investment club documents, and are best used for that purpose: Investment Clubs. _[More about Syndicate](/legal/llcs/investment-club/README.md)._

- The [Standalone Limited Liability Company Agreement](/legal/llcs/investment-club/LLC-standalone.md) creates an LLC between the Members for a given purpose.
- The [Subscription Agreement](/legal/llcs/investment-club/investment-club.md) allows an individual (the "Subscriber") to tender an interest in an Investor Club LLC (the "Vehicle").
- The [Series LLC Agreement](/legal/llcs/investment-club/operating-agreement-investment-club-series-LLC.md) allows a group of Members to create a _Series LLC_—Series LLCs allow a company to create various sub-LLCs to isolate various assets and operations. Each sub-LLC is called a _series_, and is treated separately for liability purposes, just as if it were its own LLC.
- The [Series Addendum Agreement](/legal/llcs/investment-club/series-addendum-agreement.md) creates a series, and should be filed alongside the Series LLC Agreement mentioned above.

### C Corporation

According to the [U.S. Small Business Administration](https://www.sba.gov/business-guide/launch-your-business/choose-business-structure):

> _A corporation, sometimes called a C corp, is a legal entity that's separate from its owners. Corporations can make a profit, be taxed, and can be held legally liable._
>
> _Corporations offer the strongest protection to its owners from personal liability, but the cost to form a corporation is higher than other structures. Corporations also require more extensive record-keeping, operational processes, and reporting._
>
> _Unlike sole proprietors, partnerships, and LLCs, corporations pay income tax on their profits. In some cases, corporate profits are taxed twice — first, when the company makes a profit, and again when dividends are paid to shareholders on their personal tax returns._

- C Corporations can raise funds through the sale of stock, which can be a benefit in attracting employees.
- C Corporations can provide separation between ownership and management.
- C corporations limit the liability of investors and firm owners since the most that they can lose in the business’ failure is the amount they have invested in it.
- C Corporations are "double taxed", on an entity level and on dividends distributed to shareholders.

#### For Your Project

> _Corporations can be a good choice for medium- or higher-risk businesses, those that need to raise money, and businesses that plan to "go public" or eventually be sold._

This website provides a variety of documents related to the formation and operation of a C Corporation, including actions, bylaws, stock agreements, and more. See the [C Corporation Overview](/legal/ccorp/README.md) for further information.

### S Corporation

According to the [U.S. Small Business Administration](https://www.sba.gov/business-guide/launch-your-business/choose-business-structure):

> An S corporation, sometimes called an S corp, is a special type of corporation that's designed to avoid the double taxation drawback of regular C corps. S corps allow profits, and some losses, to be passed through directly to owners' personal income without ever being subject to corporate tax rates.
>
> S corps must file with the IRS to get S corp status, a different process from registering with their state.

Filing as an S corporation can help to save on taxes, but there are [specific requirements](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/s-corporations) for operating as one. To be an S corporation, your business must:

- Be a domestic corporation
- Have only allowable shareholders
  > - May be individuals, certain trusts, and estates and
  > - may not be partnerships, corporations or non-resident alien shareholders
- Have no more than 100 shareholders
- Have only one class of stock
- Not be an ineligible corporation (i.e. certain financial institutions, insurance companies, and domestic international sales corporations).

S corporations also have unique filing requirements: to learn more, visit [irs.gov](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/s-corporations).

#### For Your Project

S corporations are a good choice for project creators looking to avoid the "double taxation" associated with C corporations.

- The [S corporation bylaws](/legal/scorp/s-corp-bylaws.md) are a sensible S corporation starting point.
- To obtain other S corporation tax filing documents for corporations and tax holders, visit [irs.gov](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/s-corporations).
