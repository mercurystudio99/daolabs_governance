Growing a community from scratch is already extremely difficult — having to navigate U.S. laws and regulations on top of that can feel impossible, especially when utilizing technology as new as cryptocurrency. For builders, DAOs, artist communities, and other groups looking to take advantage of what cryptocurrency has to offer, this can quickly become an insurmountable challenge.

This website is a step towards solving this problem: It will guide you through creating a [Juicebox](#what-is-juicebox) for your project while adhering to United States laws and regulations, step-by-step (with other helpful tips along the way). In specific, this website will automatically customize and format vetted legal documents based on simple inputs — in some cases, only your project's name and a date. The documents cover a variety of use-cases and applications for individuals, DAOs, communities, and profit-seeking entities alike.

Keep in mind that these documents are a starting point, and should not be construed as legal advice. They will get you _most_ of the way there, but you should talk to a lawyer before putting them into practice. Check with a legal expert before using any of the information provided by this website. If you need help finding a legal expert, visit the [Service Provider Database](providers.md).

## Prerequisites

- A basic understanding of blockchains—Ethereum in particular. If you're new to crypto or need a refresher, read: [What is Ethereum?](https://ethereum.org/what-is-ethereum/)
- An Ethereum wallet and some ETH to cover gas fees. You can get a free Ethereum wallet and buy ETH with [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) or [Coinbase](https://coinbase.com/).
- ~60 minutes of time.

## What is Juicebox?

The Juicebox protocol allows people and communities to raise funds and issue tokens, and to determine what utility (if any) those tokens provide. Juicebox is used by DAOs, crowdfunding campaigns, artist/musician communities, developers, and others — in short, anybody looking to transparently fund and operate their project.

Juicebox is non-custodial, granting you full ownership over your project and funds. Control of a project is represented by an Ethereum NFT which you can hold in your wallet, safeguard in a multisig, or even operate from within a governance smart contract.

Specifically, Juicebox allows people to:

- Accept funds on the [Ethereum blockchain](https://ethereum.org/).
- Reward financial contributors with tokens and/or NFTs.
- Reserve a percentage of tokens for themselves, community members, builders, or anybody else.
- Customize the price of tokens, or automatically increase the price over time.
- Customize if and how users can redeem their tokens and reclaim funds.
- Mint tokens on demand.
- Distribute funds to themselves, service providers, builders, or anybody else.

All of these abilities can be pre-programmed and updated over time through the use of **Funding Cycles**, which are lengths of time that determine how a project operates and how it can be configured.

If you have any questions throughout this process, ask for help in the [Juicebox Discord server](https://discord.gg/juicebox).
