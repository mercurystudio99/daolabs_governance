# What is a security?

Unfortunately, _even federal courts_ have recognized that the definition of a security is "broad and ambiguous." Consequently, it is difficult to lay out a bright line rule by which a security can easily be distinguished from a non-security. Instead, courts have designed a flexible test that intended to "to meet the countless and variable schemes devised by those who seek the use of money of others on the promise of profits."

In particular, the U.S. Supreme Court has outlined a four-part test for determining whether a transaction qualifies as a form of a security called an "investment contract." Originally set forth in SEC v. W.J. Howey Co., the Court has explained that a transaction is an "investment contract" when it involves:

> 1. an investment of money
> 2. in a common enterprise
> 3. with an expectation of profit
> 4. to be derived from the efforts of others.

There is a long history of cases interpreting whether various financial instruments meet this definition of a security, covering everything from bank certificates of deposits to interests in whiskey barrels. There are many more cases analyzing various elements of the Howey test, each hinging on the specific facts of a particular transaction. Some of the most influential cases have been compiled below.

As proof of the inherent difficulty in defining a clear border between what is and is not a security, there have been numerous instances of courts applying the Howey test to seemingly similar transactions and coming to different results. For example, there are several cases holding certain real estate leases to be securities when offered in a particular manner. Likewise, there are numerous cases addressing when the sale of a tangible product (like the sale of beavers) may be offered as part of a securities transaction. These cases demonstrate that courts place less of a premium on the nature of the underlying product being sold and more on the manner in which it was sold.[^1]

### 1. Token Purchasers cannot have an expectation of profits from the efforts of others.

In general, there is no expectation of profits where purchasers are primarily led to purchase an item for use or consumption, even in the future.[^2] Nor is there a reasonable expectation of profits merely because the promoter mentions that an item could increase in value or that the purchaser could profit:

- _Alunni, 445 F. App’x at 292:_ No investment contract in purchase of condominiums where promotional materials stated that purchasers would receive immediate income and did not have to manage their units.
- _Revak v. SEC Realty Corp., 18 F.3d 81, 84 (2d Cir. 1994):_ No investment contract where condominiums were marketed for “the income to be derived from rentals, and the prospect of capital appreciation.
- _Hart, 735 F.2d at 1003:_ No investment contract for model home purchases where promotional materials touted "the potential for excellent appreciation in value during the holding period".

### 2. Even if purchasers can reasonably expect profits, such expectation must be based on the "undeniably significant" entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of the promoter.

In _S.E.C. v. Glenn W. Turner Enters., Inc., 474 F.2d 476, 482 (9th Cir. 1973)_ the court emphasized that even if purchasers expected a profit, that profit must be based in the "undeniably significant" entrepreneurial efforts of the promoter. These efforts must be value generating, which excludes foundational efforts such as building infrastructure.[^3] Additionally, the Commission cannot consider any profits from resale on any secondary market — this similarly falls outside the scope of Howey. Importantly, if the purchaser has complete control over the item or interest purchased, he or she does not expect profits from the efforts of others.[^4]

As the court explained in _United Housing Foundation, Inc. v. Forman, 421_, when a promoter sells an item for consumptive use rather than as a passive investment, federal securities laws do not apply. Courts have found no investment contract even where the consumptive use of the item in question is not available at the time of purchase.[^5] This is true even where the seller is the only entity who can create the eventual use. In other words, a delay in the ability to "consume" the product after purchase is not determinative.

The Supreme Court’s decision in Forman is instructive. In the case, a one-time purchase of shares proportional to the number of rooms in a housing co-op was not an investment contract despite the fact that the co-op was not ready for move-in at the time of the transaction. Even though purchasers did not hold legal title to the apartments and could not “consume” the product for years until the project was complete, the transactions were not considered “investment contracts.”

In addition, the courts have held that where a contract involves a sale of a commodity and expected profits arise primarily from resale on the secondary market, the final prong of Howey is not satisfied:

- In _Noa v. Key Futures, Inc., 638 F.2d 77, 79 (9th Cir. 1980)_, the courts found no expectation of profits from the efforts of others under Howey because once the commodity was purchased, the profits of the investor depended on market fluctuations, not the managerial efforts of the defendant.
- Also see _S.E.C. v. Belmont Reid & Co., Inc., 794 F.2d 1388, 1391 (9th Cir. 1986)_, which had a similar outcome.

### 3. The SEC's current position on Secondary Markets.

For cryptocurrencies, tokens, and NFTs, there is an additional issue: secondary markets, or sales in which the original issuer is not a party. Even among lawyers, there is significant confusion as to how Howey should apply to secondary market transactions. Even if an initial sale of a token or NFT had some of the features of a "security", it is unclear whether a subsequent transaction by the token purchaser to another purchaser for a different token would also qualify as a securities transaction. This confusion is the result of the fact that virtually every case applying Howey to cryptocurrency was decided based on a transaction in which a seller or promoter is promising the purchaser some form of financial return based on the purchase of the cryptocurrency.

The SEC, the primary regulator of the securities market in the US, has been active in voicing its opinion about certain activities in the crypto asset industry. The SEC's first major foray in the industry came in July 2017 in the form of [a report stating that sale of tokens by "The DAO" constituted a sale of securities](https://www.sec.gov/litigation/investreport/34-81207.pdf). The SEC has since reached settlements with several industry participants and also issued several statements about when certain activities within the industry may be subject to securities regulations. Notably, some members of the SEC have said that they believe that the vast majority of tokens sold as part of a fundraising effort (so called "ICOs") were securities offerings.

In March 2019, the SEC's Strategic Hub for Innovation and Financial Technology (aka FinHub) issued a regulatory scheme intended to help those within the crypto asset industry evaluate which assets may be viewed by the SEC as securities. The FinHub regulations identify numerous factors to consider when analyzing whether the sale of a crypto asset meets the final two prongs of the Howey test: whether there is (i) an expectation of profit (ii) based on the efforts of a third party. The framework places a strong emphasis on factors used to determine whether an "Active Participant" exists that provides "essential managerial efforts that effect the success of the enterprise, and investors reasonably expect to derive profits from those efforts."

Currently, one of the largest areas of debate relating to the SEC's position on the crypto asset industry is how it plans to apply securities law to secondary market trading of tokens that may have initially been sold as part of a securities offering. The SEC's own Director of Corporate Finance has opined that "strictly speaking, the token – or coin or whatever the digital information packet is called – all by itself is not a security." The Director, instead, noted that "a careful and fact-sensitive legal analysis" of secondary market trading is necessary, focused on how the token is offered and sold, including the reasonable expectations of purchasers. The Director offered one standard for determining when a token does not qualify as a security based on whether the network upon which a token exists is "sufficiently decentralized." This standard was laid out by the Director who also identified several factors that could be considered to determine whether a token is "sufficiently decentralized." The more-recent FinHub framework also addresses this issue, but does not use the term "sufficiently decentralized." Instead, the framework lays out several factors to be analyzed to determine whether the value of the asset is still dependent on the efforts of the "Active Participants" and to what extent the underlying network technology is fully functional.

The conclusion derived from these statements is that the SEC has recognized that a crypto asset previously sold in a securities offering can later be sold on the secondary market in a non-securities transaction under certain circumstances. However, there are still many questions about the standard the SEC will use to distinguish between transactions of crypto assets as a security or non-security. Unfortunately, despite advocating for a nuanced analysis of each token's network to make such a determination, the SEC has not demonstrated it will follow these guidelines in the enforcement actions it has brought against certain industry participants. Instead, the SEC has issued orders in settled cases involving secondary market participants in which it has alleged without further explanation that the tokens themselves are securities, despite the problems outlined above. Therefore, it is unclear exactly what analysis the SEC is currently using as it relates to secondary market transactions of crypto assets.
