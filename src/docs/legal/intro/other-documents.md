### Promissory Note (Loan)

A _promissory note_, or a note payable, is an unconditional promise to pay a specific amount of money or property (the "principal") to another party at a specific time or times. Promissory notes usually include interest, and may contain additional terms, including terms for paying in installments, penalties, and more.

- Promissory notes are an agreement, and do not typically need to be filed with any authorities.
- _Secured promissory notes_ are secured by some type of collateral, such as a piece of property or an asset (like an NFT).
- Under an _unsecured promissory note_, the lender has no right to any property or collateral, even if the loaned funds were used to purchase it. Usually, loans which are unsecured carry higher interest rates.
- As long as the interest rate is legal, there is no limit to the number of promissory notes a party may borrow or enter into.

Promissory notes can be used whenever money or property will be borrowed and repaid at a later time. This could be for the purpose of purchasing an asset, funding a production, or another purpose.

For your project, keep in mind that any two entities can agree to promissory notes, and that there is no limit to the number of promissory notes a party may enter into. The project creator, community members, builders, or specific individuals or entities can all be lenders or borrowers.
