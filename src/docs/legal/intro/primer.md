This document will introduce you to several foundational legal concepts, and explain how they relate to your project.

### 1. Laws.

_Common law_, also known as case law, is the body of unwritten laws based on legal precedent established by the courts. This is a result of previous civil and criminal litigation brought forth to the courts, in response to which a judge or jury renders a decision — this is also called _judicial precedent_.

Generally, common law encompasses contract law and the law of torts. _Contract law_ concerns itself with agreements between individuals and organizations, also known as parties. _Torts_ concerns the legal action between parties arising from disputes. A "tort" is an act or omission that gives rise to injury to another party and the amounts to a civil wrong for which the courts impose liability.

Statutes are laws which are enacted by legislature, or regulatory law. Where you are located and what countries you interact with determine what statutes are applicable to you. This is your jurisdiction.

### 2. Contracts.

When two parties reach an agreement, this agreement is a _contract_. A contract creates a legal obligation between both parties. Both parties in a contract must fulfill their duties as specified in the contract. For instance, one party could be bound to deliver certain goods after receiving payment from the other party.

**Although courts lend more credence to written contracts, a contract can be either written or verbal. It's also possible for a person to enter into a contract through their actions. Parties can use contracts for the sale of both goods and services.** A valid contract includes three important features:

- **Mutual Assent.** All contracted parties should understand the contract's subject matter and its specific terms.
- **Offer and Acceptance.** One party makes an offer indicating their willingness to enter a contract, and the other party unambiguously accepts the offer.
- **Consideration.** The parties agree to exchange something of value, whether money or performance of an act.

When a contract breach occurs, several different remedies are available to the injured party. The remedies available in contract claims depend on the nature of the breach, and can be either equitable or legal. A legal remedy usually involves the party that breached the contract providing monetary restitution for the losses suffered by the other party. Legal remedies can take several different forms, such as compensatory damages, consequential damages, or liquidated damages.

An equitable remedy requires that the breaching party take steps to make up for the breach. Equitable remedies can include canceling the contract, known as rescission, or reforming the contract. Both contract claims and remedies can be very complicated because it can be difficult to determine the actual harm caused by a contract breach. For a contract breach to exist, there must be four crucial elements:

- Formation of a contract.
- The contract includes enforceable performance terms.
- One party does not perform their contractual obligations.
- The failure to perform injures the other party.

#### For Your Project

The **Project Owner** is the person who creates the project. The **Contributor** is the person who contributes to the project. The **Beneficiary** is the person who receives the funds from the project. The **Project Owner** has a duty to be forthright [^1] and honest with the **Contributors** and failure to do so may result harm. Upon **Contributor's** sending of funds to the **Project** an **Agreement** has been formed. Parties to an **Agreement** have duties to each other, which if breached may give rise to an injury. The law provides remedies for those who are injured, such as financially, based on a breach of contract.

### 3. Duties.

A legal duty is an obligation, created by law or contract. A legal duty requires a person to conform their actions to a particular standard. It also carries with it a recognition that the law will enforce this duty to the benefit of other individuals to whom this duty is owed. Put another way, the existence of a legal duty depends on whether the interest that a defendant has allegedly invaded is entitled to legal protection. For example, in the context of tort law, a landowner may have a legal duty to protect invitees from hazards on their property, such as an open pit.[^2] In such a case, if his guest were to be injured, the landowner would have breached his duty.

A number of duties exist: Wikipedia[^3] mentions duties to care, candour, defend, settle, rescue, retreat, to report a felony, vote, warn, fiduciary duties, special duties formed upon contracts, and in loco parentis (in the place of a parent).

#### For Your Project

Implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing (often simplified to "good faith") is a rule used by most courts in the United States that requires every party in a contract to implement the agreement as intended, not using any means to undercut the purpose of the transaction. _[More on good faith and fair dealing →](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/implied_covenant_of_good_faith_and_fair_dealing)_

_What duties does a **Juicebox Project Owner** owe after creating a Juicebox Project and subsequently promoting it?_

Once configured, the Juicebox Protocol operates as a **Project Token** issuance machine and a Cryptocurrency redemption system. It manages inflows and outflows, enforcing the rules set by the **Project Owner**.

While the mechanics are transparent, they are nuanced, and the **Project Manager** is fully responsible for their configuration - the Juicebox Protocol only enforces those settings. As set forth in the [**Juicebox Terms of Service**](https://info.juicebox.money/tos/), the Project Owner is responsible for ensuring that any configurations are made such that any applicable laws are adhered to. Nonetheless, once the Project Owner deploys the project and makes statements as to the purpose of the project, and after **Contributors** take actions such as transmitting Cryptocurrency or anything of value to the project, those collective actions could be interpreted as forming an agreement between the parties.

The basic elements required for the agreement to be a legally enforceable contract are: mutual assent, expressed by a valid offer and acceptance; adequate consideration; capacity; and legality. In some states, element of consideration can be satisfied by a valid substitute. In other words, contracts are promises that the law will enforce.

However, funds are eventually released from the protocol at the behest of the **Project Owner**. You, as that **Project Owner**, have a duty of fair dealing.[^4]

### 4. Entities.

In simplest terms, a business entity is an organization created by an individual or a group of individuals to conduct business, engage in a trade, or partake in similar activities. There are various types of business entities — sole proprietorships, partnerships, LLCs, corporations, and so on — and a business's entity type dictates both its structure and how that business is taxed.

When starting a business, one of the first things you want to do is choose the structure of your company — in other words, choose a business entity type.[^5]

Generally, when establishing an entity, you register in the state where your business is located. The entity is organized between individuals by a written or oral agreement, or by performance.

Corporate law is the practice of law in which the shareholders, directors, and officers and their relationships, rights (both statutory and common), contract, and duties are defined. The existence of an association of individuals operating as an unincorporated organization is so common that several [_model acts_](https://www.uniformlaws.org/committees/community-home?CommunityKey=40227d3a-8b5d-47c2-8cd0-b0ec12da97f9)[^6] exist for states to expand upon. Whether or not a state has specific statutes recognizing DAOs and the activities of the individuals which make up the DAO are instructive, and will often dictate the business entity which should be used.

#### For Your Project

As highlighted above, there are several factors which determine what structure and duties are reasonable for your project:

- What representations have been made by the association (project members) to the public,
- what is the purpose of the association, and finally,
- do the participants (project owner, members, contributors) have an expectation of profit?

This website provides formation documents for several structures. If you're interested in creating a for-profit entity, **continue by reading [4a. For-profit](for-profit.md).[^7]**

If you're interested in creating a charity, a public good, or another type of non-profit, **continue by reading [4b. Non-profit](non-profit.md).**

Optionally, if you're making a DAO, Miles Jennings and David Kerr's [How to pick a DAO legal entity](https://a16zcrypto.com/dao-legal-entity-how-to-pick/) is well worth examining.

[^1]: When parties of a contract (including verbal contracts) enter into an agreement, each party has a **duty**. For the **Project Owner** it is performance, for the **Contributor** it is to pay. The Project Owner's failure to perform, or them performing an activity incongruent with the aforementioned agreement, may cause a breach of the contract.
