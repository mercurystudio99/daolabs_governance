Growing a community from scratch is already extremely difficult—having to navigate U.S. laws and regulations on top of that can feel impossible, especially utilizing technology as new as cryptocurrency. For builders, DAOs, artist communities, and other groups looking to take advantage of what cryptocurrency has to offer, this can quickly become an insurmountable challenge.

This website is a step towards solving this problem: It will guide you through creating a [Juicebox](/legal/intro/start.md#what-is-juicebox) for your project while adhering to United States laws and regulations, step-by-step (with other helpful tips along the way). In specific, this website will automatically customize and format vetted legal documents based on simple inputs—in some cases, only your project's name and a date. The documents cover a variety of use-cases and applications for individuals, DAOs, communities, and profit-seeking entities alike.

To create a Juicebox project, visit [juicebox.money](https://juicebox.money/create). You can learn about configuring your project with the [Juicebox Docs](https://info.juicebox.money/user)
