Before creating your project, invest some time into figuring out the details. Establishing these key points in advance will save you hours later on:

### 1. Purpose and scope.

Juicebox projects can be extremely flexible â€” having a clear purpose and scope will help you make further decisions. Try writing out the following:

> - A one-sentence project description.
> - A paragraph project description.
> - A full project description, including a project plan.

### 2. Project details.

1. A project name. Think of something short, memorable, and distinct.
2. A project description. This brief paragraph (less than 5000 characters) should include the project's purpose and a brief overview of your plans.
3. A distinct logo (which can be a GIF). The best logos work at a variety of sizes.
4. A website where people can learn more. If you don't have a website, you can link to a social media profile, make a [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) page, or use a no-code service like [WebFlow](https://webflow.com/).
5. (RECOMMENDED) A Twitter page and a Discord server. These platforms are extremely popular within web3, and for good reason: Discord allows you to engage and interact with your community, and Twitter will help your community grow. _See the [Discord guide](https://info.juicebox.money/user/resources/discord/) for templates and more._

### 3. Publicly known individual(s).

Although fully anonymous projects have achieved success, having one or more known identities associated with your project increase the chances of success by offering credibility and trust.

### 4. Service provider.

DAOs and other groups often employ a _Service provider_ to manage the filing and operation of legal entities associated with their projects. If you need help finding a legal expert, visit the [Service Provider Database](providers.md).
