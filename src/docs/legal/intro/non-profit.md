Whether your Juicebox treasury requires a formal legal structure, a collection of written agreements, or remains unincorporated is ultimately up to you. This page describes how legal frameworks may be employed for Juicebox projects with non-profit purposes. _As a reminder, this documentation, the Juicebox Discord server, and the Juicebox Docs are not replacements for legal, tax, or accounting advice. Please do your own research._

### Nonprofit Status

According to the [IRS](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/exempt-organization-types):

> _Organizations organized and operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, testing for public safety, literary, educational, or other specified purposes and that meet certain other requirements are tax exempt under Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(3)._

There are specific requirements to receive this exemption—for an overview, read [_Exemption Requirements - 501(c)(3) Organizations_](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/exemption-requirements-501c3-organizations). In short, the organization must be operated **exclusively** for exempt purposes (such as those listed above), and none of its earnings may inure to any private shareholder or individual. Nonprofit corporations also have unique [filing requirements](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/annual-filing-and-forms).

If your project meets the criteria above, organizing as a nonprofit corporation can dramatically reduce or altogether eliminate your tax liability.

### Unincorporated Nonprofit Association.

:::info
The legal ramifications of Unincorporated Nonprofit Associations (UNAs) differ slightly from state to state. Resources on this website are written with regards to Nevada and Delaware UNAs. As always, do your own research, speak to legal experts, and check your state's laws.
:::

According to [Nevada Statutes](https://www.leg.state.nv.us/nrs/nrs-081.html#NRS081Sec700), an "Unincorporated Nonprofit Association" (or "UNA") is an unincorporated organization consisting of two or more members joined under an agreement that is oral, in a record or implied from conduct, for one or more common nonprofit purposes.

- An UNA _may_ distribute funds so long as those distributions are in furtherance of its non-profit purposes.
- An UNA is a legal entity distinct from its members and managers—UNAs can hold property, debts, liabilities, and may sue others or be sued.
- UNAs are formed by an agreement between their members, and do not typically need to file incorporating documents with any state authorities.
- UNAs can operate as a tax-exempt nonprofit if the purpose of its activity is of public benefit, and its annual revenues are less than $5,000. UNAs may also apply for 501(c)(3) status.
- UNAs may incur a tax liability.

Whether you know this or not, most informal groups are effectively "unincorporated associations". Common examples include neighborhood watches, groups pooling funds for non-profit reasons, and little league or similar teams. Simply by association, an entity is formed.

You should be aware that the U.S. government frequently charges individuals for 18 U.S. Code 371, or conspiracy: _"two or more persons conspir[ing] either to commit any offense against the United States"._ Simply put: individuals associated with each other for an unlawful purpose.

#### For Your Project

Unincorporated Nonprofit Associations work best for projects with token-based membership and governance. You may want to utilize an UNA if you're forming a non-profit DAO, a charity, or any project with a public good or non-profit purpose.

- Projects with off-chain governance (such as Snapshot) may be able to use a [Nevada Unincorporated Nonprofit Association Agreement](/legal/unas/nevada.md).
- Projects with on-chain governance may be able to use a [Delaware Unincorporated Nonprofit Association Agreement](/legal/unas/delaware.md).

### Ownerless Foundation (Nonprofit Corporation)

An ownerless foundation is managed by a council or a board, which can itself be directed by token holders, an advisory comittee, or something else. Board/council members have fiduciary obligations to the community, which can be to promote community or product growth and development.

- Typically, token holders do not have a direct ownership relationship with the foundation.
- Foundations are corporations, and thus have annual reporting filing requirements.
- Foundations have legal personhood.
- Founders may be responsible for liabilities not arising from the foundation, or for liabilities that founders cause the foundation to take on.
- Foundations are not typically used for raising capital.

#### For Your Project

Ownerless foundations can be effective for communities looking to delegate authority over certain assets (including tokens, intellectual property, or onchain assets) to a board or council with fiduciary duty to the wider community and its goals. Ownerless foundations are often utilized by protocol DAOs.

- The [Foundation Bylaws](/legal/foundation/foundation-bylaws.md) are a sensible starting point for forming a Washington ownerless foundation.

### Trust

According to the [IRS](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/definition-of-a-trust):

> _In general, a trust is a relationship in which one person holds title to property, subject to an obligation to keep or use the property for the benefit of another._

Put otherwise, a trust is a right in property which is held by one party for the benefit of another. The _trustee_ holds title to the trust property, and the _beneficiary_ receives the benefits of the trust. The person or entity transferring property to the trust is the _settlor_.

- Trusts do not have legal personhood. The trustee is the principal actor and carries out the purposes of the trust in his own name. This can be beneficial from a tax perspective—beneficiaries are often taxed as the direct owners of the trust property.
- Trusts are flexible. Usually, provisions of a trust can be whatever is agreed between the settlor and the trustee.
- Trusts can be valuable for maintaining confidentiality. [The terms of a Trust Agreement](/legal/trusts/trust.md) are usually not accessible to third parties. Instead, a [Declaration of Trust](/legal/trusts/declaration-of-trust.md) which states the high-level terms of the agreement may be notarized and provided to 3rd parties who are required to validate ownership.
- Typically, trusts do not need to be filed. Unless there is a lawsuit concerning your trust, it usually won't become a matter of public record.

#### For Your Project

Juicebox projects have facilitated some of the largest fundraisers of all time. A one-time fundraise may be accomplished via a [trust agreement](/legal/trusts/README.md) where as the contributors are the settlors, the individual who created the project is the trustee, and the beneficiary is the individual(s) who will receive the funds.

You can also use a trust for a [GoFundMe](https://www.gofundme.com/)-style fundraiser to pay for medical or other expenses for a family member, a friend, or even a pet.

Whether an attorney is available to help prepare the documents, or you edit the documents and make them available to the community, this device has substantial statutory law protecting the contributors and the beneficiary.

This website includes templates for:

- A [Trust Agreement](/legal/trusts/trust-agreement.md), which is used to establish a trust.
- A [Declaration of Trust](/legal/trusts/declaration-of-trust.md), which is provided to third parties.

- The [Uniform Trust Code](https://www.uniformlaws.org/HigherLogic/System/DownloadDocumentFile.ashx?DocumentFileKey=6bae0bb2-00ea-8080-d084-5be9ef7bbc66).
