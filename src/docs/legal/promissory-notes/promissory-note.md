<p align="center">PROMISSORY NOTE<br />
Maximum Amount: [Loan-amount] dollars</p>

Latest Update: **[Date]**

> **FOR VALUE RECEIVED**, the undersigned, **[Borrower-name]**, a(n) **[Borrower-entity-type]** (“Borrower”), hereby promises to pay to **[Lender-name]**, a **[Lender-entity-type]** (“Lender”), or order, on demand the principal sum of **[Loan-amount]** dollars or so much of the principal sum as may from time to time have been advanced and be outstanding, together with accrued interest, as provided herein. Borrower and Lender are sometimes referred to herein as a “Party” or, collectively, as the “Parties.”

> This Note is being delivered in connection with the performance and payment of development services ("Services"), and amounts outstanding under this Note represent portion of the amounts owed to Lender, as the Borrower informs what percentage of the funds are subsequently earned and the Borrower is required to ensure that the reconciliation of payments which are apportioned as a loan and which are earned every 4 months, or when it is reasonable.

### **1. Principal.**

> **(a) Advances.** Prior to the date of this Note, Lender has advanced Borrower the aggregate sum of **[Lender-advanced-amount]** dollars (the “Initial Advance”). In connection with the performance of the Services, Borrower may from time to time request that the repayment of amounts due pursuant thereunder be satisfied through additional advances from Lender pursuant to this Note (individually, an “Advance” and, collectively with the Initial Advance and each other Advance, the “Advances”) by giving notice to Lender, which notice shall indicate the amount of the Advance requested and the related invoice issued pursuant to the Services. Provided that no Event of Default (as defined below) is in existence and that the requested Advance would not cause an Event of Default to occur,
>
> - (i) Lender may, without obligation and in its sole discretion, make the Advance to Borrower within two (2) business days of receipt of Borrower’s notice by providing notice of the Advance to Borrower (without any cash payment to Borrower under this Note), and
> - (ii) Borrower shall have the right to re-borrow any Advance to the extent that it has been repaid.

> **(b) Notation of Advances.** With respect to any Advances, Lender is hereby authorized to note the date of disbursement, principal amount, and any payments made thereon on Lender’s books and records (either manually or by electronic entry) and/or on any schedule attached to this Note, which notations shall be prima facie evidence of the accuracy of the information noted; provided, however, that failure to make any notation, recordation or endorsement (or any errors in notation) shall not affect Borrower’s obligations hereunder and payments of principal by Borrower shall be credited to Borrower notwithstanding the failure to make a notation thereof (or errors in notation). Borrower authorizes Lender to endorse this Note and to attach to and make a part of this Note a continuation of any such schedule as and when required.

> **(c) Use of Proceeds.** The proceeds of Advances shall be used to satisfy outstanding invoices of Lender delivered to Borrower from time to time in connection with the performance of the Services. Promptly following the date of an Advance, Lender shall take such actions to indicate that the invoice applicable to such Advance has been paid in full by Borrower.

> **(d) Loan Fee.** Upon execution of this Note, Borrower will pay to Lender a fully earned, non-refundable loan fee of **[Loan-fee]** dollars.

### **2. Interest.**

> Interest shall accrue daily from the applicable dates of disbursement, computed on the principal balances hereof from time to time outstanding, at a rate of **[Annual-interest-rate]** percent per annum (the “Applicable Rate”) until all obligations under this Note have been paid in full. Interest shall be computed on the basis of a 365-day year and shall be assessed for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).

### **3. Default Interest.**

> If an Event of Default occurs, then, at the option of Lender hereof and without notice or demand, the entire balance of principal and accrued interest then remaining unpaid shall be immediately due, payable and collectible by Lender and shall thereafter bear interest, until paid in full, at the increased rate of **[Annual-interest-rate-default]** percent per annum over and above the Applicable Rate. Borrower acknowledges and agrees that during the continuance of an Event of Default, Lender will incur additional costs and expenses attributable to its loss of use of the money due and to the adverse impact on Lender’s ability to avail itself of other opportunities. Borrower acknowledges and agrees that it is extremely difficult and impractical to ascertain the extent of such costs and expenses and that proof of actual damages would be costly or inconvenient. Borrower therefore agrees that interest at the increased rate of **[Annual-interest-rate-default]** percent per annum over and above the Applicable Rate represents a reasonable sum considering all the circumstances existing on the date of this Note and represents a fair and reasonable estimate of such costs and expenses. No delay or omission on the part of Lender hereof in exercising any right hereunder or under any other agreement shall operate as a waiver of such right or of any other right under this Note or under any such other agreement.

### **4. Payment.**

> **(a) Scheduled Repayment.** The principal indebtedness of the Advances, together with all accrued but unpaid interest, shall be due and payable on **[Maturity-date]** (the “Maturity Date”), unless extended by agreement of the Parties.

> **(b) Prepayment.** Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay, in whole or in part, the principal of this Note, without payment of any premium or penalty. Any principal prepayment shall be accompanied by a payment of all interest accrued on the amount prepaid through the date of such prepayment. All payments shall be applied first to accrued interest and thereafter to principal.

> **(c) Form of Payment.** Principal, interest, fees, and all other amounts due hereunder are to be paid in lawful money of the United States of America in cash or other immediately available funds.

### **5. Warrant Coverage.**

- [ ] Upon the execution of this Note, Borrower hereby grants to Lender a warrant to purchase fully paid, nonassessable shares of common stock of Borrower at a per share exercise price of **[Warrant-strike-price]** dollars, in substantially the form of Exhibit A hereto.

### **6. Events of Default.**

> **(a) Definition of Event of Default.** The occurrence of any one or more of the following events shall constitute an **“Event of Default”** hereunder:

> > **(i)** Borrower’s breach of the obligation to pay any amount payable hereunder within **[Borrower-default-days]** days after the date that it is due and payable;
> > **(ii)** Borrower’s institution of proceedings or filing of a petition seeking reorganization or release under the federal Bankruptcy Code, or any other applicable federal or state law relating to creditor rights and remedies, or Borrower’s consent to the filing of any such petition or the appointment of a receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee or other similar official of Borrower or of any substantial part of its property, or Borrower’s making of an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the taking of corporate action in furtherance of such action; or
> > **(iii)** the entry of any judgment or order against Borrower which could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Borrower’s business and which remains unsatisfied or undischarged and in effect for thirty (30) days after such entry without a stay of enforcement or execution.
> > **(b) Rights and Remedies on Event of Default.** During the continuance of an Event of Default, as provided in Section 3 above, Lender may accelerate the payment of the amounts due by Borrower hereunder and enforce this Note by exercise of the rights and remedies granted to it by applicable law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default pursuant to Section 4(a)(ii) above, all principal and accrued but unpaid interest hereunder shall be immediately due, payable and collectible by Lender.

### **7. JURY WAIVER; GOVERNING LAW; VENUE.**

> BORROWER AND LENDER IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY IN CONNECTION WITH ANY CLAIM OR RIGHT ARISING OUT OF THIS NOTE OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED IN THIS NOTE. THIS NOTE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF **[State-jurisdiction]**, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES.
