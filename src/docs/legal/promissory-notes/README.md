title: Promissory Note (Loans)
---

A _promissory note_, or a note payable, is an unconditional promise to pay a specific amount of money or property (the "principal") to another party at a specific time or times. Promissory notes usually include interest, and may contain additional terms, including terms for paying in installments, penalties, and more.

- Promissory notes are an agreement, and do not typically need to be filed with any authorities.
- Secured promissory notes are secured by some type of collateral, such as a piece of property or asset, like an NFT.
- Under an unsecured promissory note, the lender has no right to any property or collateral, even if the loaned funds were used to purchase it. Usually, loans which are unsecured carry higher interest rates.
- As long as the interest rate is legal, there is no limit to the number of promissory notes a party may borrow or enter into.

## Usage

Promissory notes can be used whenever money or property will be borrowed and repaid at a later time. This could be for the purpose of purchasing an asset, funding a production, or another purpose.

For your project, keep in mind that any two entities can agree to promissory notes, and that there is no limit to the number of promissory notes a party may enter into. The project creator, community members, builders, or specific individuals or entities can all be lenders or borrowers.

## Note

Promissory notes are often abused by individuals or entities with no intention of repaying them. Individuals with secret off-shore undisclosed assets in the Cayman Islands may use promissory notes to represent magical funds or assets. Entering into illusory promissory notes is questionable legally, and likely results in the money or benefit being confirmed considered income. Therefore, aside from honestly entering into a promissory note with the intention of repaying it, its important the following features are well understood.

1. The parties involved;
2. the amount of the loan;
3. the amount to be repaid;
4. when and how often the payments are to be made;
5. repayment, with dates if possible;
6. what happens when a payment is late or isn't repaid;
7. interest rate, whether fixed variable or increases over time;
8. the party responsible for repaying the loan;
9. any applicable collateral or security;
10. any rights transferring or assigning the promissory note (promissory notes can be transferable);
11. the date and place of issuance; and,
12. the signature of the party offering.
