## Overview.

According to the [U.S. Small Business Administration](https://www.sba.gov/business-guide/launch-your-business/choose-business-structure):

> _A corporation, sometimes called a C corp, is a legal entity that's separate from its owners. Corporations can make a profit, be taxed, and can be held legally liable._
>
> _Corporations offer the strongest protection to its owners from personal liability, but the cost to form a corporation is higher than other structures. Corporations also require more extensive record-keeping, operational processes, and reporting._
>
> _Unlike sole proprietors, partnerships, and LLCs, corporations pay income tax on their profits. In some cases, corporate profits are taxed twice — first, when the company makes a profit, and again when dividends are paid to shareholders on their personal tax returns._

- C Corporations can raise funds through the sale of stock, which can be a benefit in attracting employees.
- C Corporations can provide separation between ownership and management.
- C corporations limit the liability of investors and firm owners since the most that they can lose in the business’ failure is the amount they have invested in it.
- C Corporations are "double taxed", on an entity level and on dividends distributed to shareholders.
- C corporations are mandated to hold annual meetings and have a board of directors that is voted on by shareholders.

## Documents.

2. The [Certificate of Incorporation](./2-Certificate-of-Incorporation.md) formally incorporates a C corporation.
3. [Action by Sole Incorporator](./3-Action-by-Sole-Incorporator.md) allows a C corporation to adopt bylaws and appoint an initial board member.
4. [Bylaws](./4-Bylaws.md) set forth key rules and regulations governing day-to-day operations of a C corporation.
5. [Certificate of Adoption of Bylaws](./5-Certificate-of-Adoption-of-Bylaws.md) formally adopts the bylaws in document 4.
6. [Board Action in Lieu of First Meeting](./6-Board-Action-in-Lieu-of-First-Meeting.md) contains several useful resolutions and actions concerning stock, indemnification, management, and other day-to-day concerns.
7. [IRS Form SS-4 Application for Employer Identification Number](./7-IRS-Form-SS-4-Application-for-Employer-Identification-Number.pdf) is an EIN number application. The IRS uses EINs to identify taxpayers—you need an EIN to pay taxes.
8. The [Founder Stock Agreement](./8-Restricted-Stock-Purchase-Agreement-Founder-01.md) is a Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement, typically intended to be used by the founder(s) of a company.
9. The [Common Stock Purchase Agreement](./9-Common-Stock-Purchase-Agreement.md) delineates the terms and conditions for the purchase of common stock in a C corporation.
10. [Indemnification Agreement](./11-Indemnification-Agreement-Delaware-Corporation-Founder-01.md) provides _indemnification_—put simply, indemnification is insurance/security against legal liability for one's actions.

20. The [Warrant to Purchase Common Stock](./21-Form-of-Common-Stock-Warrant.md) is a stock warrant plan.

## Jurisdiction.

The documents above are written for the jurisdiction of the State of Delaware. Each State has adopted specific State laws regulating Corporations, Partnerships, and other business entities. The states and their respective laws differ in areas of personal liability for business debts and business' tax obligations. Generally speaking, corporate laws outline the rights, responsibilities, and procedures for each given business structure.

While you may want to consult a paralegal or attorney on the matter generally or specifically, the documents above cannot simply be revised from Delaware-specific language to whichever state you wish to operate, but the corporate law statutes referenced will also need to be updated. The following table references the state statutes which correspond with corporate law in each state.
