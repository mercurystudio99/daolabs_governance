# DIRECTOR AND OFFICER INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT

THIS INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT (this "**Agreement**") is made as of February 4, 2022, by and between [Entity-name], a Delaware corporation (the "**Company**"), and the undersigned ("**Indemnitee**"). Capitalized terms not defined elsewhere in this Agreement are used as defined in Section 14.

## RECITALS

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "**Board**") has determined that it is reasonable, prudent and necessary for the Company to contractually obligate itself to indemnify, hold harmless, exonerate and advance expenses on behalf of persons who serve the Company and its direct and indirect subsidiaries, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in order to, among other things, support the retention of highly competent persons who may be hesitant to serve in such roles without such protections;

WHEREAS, this Agreement is a supplement to and in furtherance of the Company's Certificate of Incorporation (the "**Charter**") and Bylaws (the "**Bylaws**" and together with the Charter, the "**Organizational Documents**"), in each case, as may be amended from time to time, and any resolutions adopted pursuant thereto, as well as any rights of Indemnitees under any directors' and officers' policies of liability insurance, and shall not be deemed a substitute therefor, nor to diminish or abrogate any rights of Indemnitee thereunder; and

WHEREAS, Indemnitee may not be willing to serve as an officer or director without adequate protection, and the Company desires Indemnitee to serve in such capacity, and Indemnitee is willing to serve, continue to serve, and to take on additional service for or on behalf of the Company on the condition that Indemnitee be so indemnified.

## AGREEMENT

In consideration of the Indemnitee's agreement to serve as a director or officer of the Company from and after the date hereof, and the premises and the covenants contained herein, the Company and Indemnitee do hereby covenant and agree as follows:

1. **Services by Indemnitee; Indemnity of Indemnitee**. The Company hereby agrees to hold harmless and indemnify Indemnitee to the fullest extent permitted by law, as such may be amended from time to time. In furtherance of the foregoing indemnification, and without limiting the generality thereof:

> (a) **Services by Indemnitee**. Indemnitee hereby agrees to serve or continue to serve as a director or officer of the Company, for so long as Indemnitee is duly elected or appointed or until Indemnitee tenders such Indemnitee's resignation or is removed. This Agreement shall not be deemed an employment contract between the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any Enterprise and Indemnitee.
>
> (b) **Proceedings Other Than Proceedings by or in the Right of the Company**. Indemnitee shall be entitled to the rights of indemnification provided in this **Section l(b)** if, by reason of Indemnitee's Corporate Status, Indemnitee is, or is threatened to be made, a party to or participant in any Proceeding other than a Proceeding by or in the right of the Company. Pursuant to this **Section 1(b)**, Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all Expenses, judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee, or on Indemnitee's behalf, in connection with such Proceeding or any claim, issue or matter therein, if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, and with respect to any criminal Proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe Indemnitee's conduct was unlawful.
>
> (c) **Proceedings by or in the Right of the Company**. Indemnitee shall be entitled to the rights of indemnification provided in this **Section 1(c)** if, by reason of Indemnitee's Corporate Status, Indemnitee is, or is threatened to be made, a party to or participant in any Proceeding brought by or in the right of the Company. Pursuant to this **Section 1(c)**, Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee, or on Indemnitee's behalf, in connection with such Proceeding if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company; **provided**, **however**, if applicable law so provides, no indemnification against such Expenses shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter in such Proceeding as to which Indemnitee shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Company unless and to the extent that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall determine that such indemnification may be made.
>
> (d) **Indemnification for Expenses of a Party Who is Wholly or Partly Successful**. Without limiting any other provision of this Agreement, to the extent that Indemnitee is, by reason of Indemnitee's Corporate Status, a party to (or a participant in) and is successful, on the merits or otherwise, in any Proceeding or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, in whole or in part, Indemnitee shall be indemnified to the maximum extent permitted by law, as such may be amended from time to time, against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee or on Indemnitee's behalf in connection therewith. If Indemnitee is not wholly successful in such Proceeding but is successful, on the merits or otherwise, as to one or more but less than all claims, issues or matters in such Proceeding, the Company shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, indemnify Indemnitee against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee or on Indemnitee's behalf in connection with each successfully resolved claim, issue or matter. For purposes of this **Section 1(d)** and without limitation, the termination of any claim, issue or matter in such a Proceeding by dismissal, with or without prejudice, shall be deemed to be a successful result as to such claim, issue or matter.
>
> (e) **Partial Indemnification**. If Indemnitee is entitled under any provision of this Agreement to indemnification by the Company for some or a portion of Expenses, but not, however, for the total amount thereof, the Company shall nevertheless indemnify Indemnitee for the portion thereof to which Indemnitee is entitled.

2. **Additional Indemnity; Hold Harmless and Exoneration Rights**. In addition to, and without regard to any limitations on, the indemnification provided for in **Section 1** of this Agreement, the Company shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, indemnify, hold harmless and exonerate Indemnitee if Indemnitee is a party to or threatened to be made a party to any Proceeding against all Expenses and judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement in any Proceeding by or in the right of the Company to procure a judgment in its favor (including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of such Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement) actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee in connection with the Proceeding.

3. **Contribution**.

> (a) **Payment by the Company**. Whether or not the indemnification provided in **Sections 1** and **Section 2** hereof is available, in respect of any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding in which the Company is jointly liable with Indemnitee (or would be if joined in such action, suit or proceeding), the Company shall pay, in the first instance, the entire amount of any judgment or settlement of such action, suit or proceeding without requiring Indemnitee to contribute to such payment and the Company hereby waives and relinquishes any right of contribution it may have against Indemnitee.
>
> (b) **Expenses, Judgements, Fines and Settlement Amounts**. Without diminishing or impairing the obligations of the Company set forth in **Section 3(a)** hereof, if, for any reason, Indemnitee shall elect or be required to pay all or any portion of any judgment or settlement in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding in which the Company is jointly liable with Indemnitee (or would be if joined in such action, suit or proceeding), the Company shall contribute to the amount of Expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred and paid or payable by Indemnitee in proportion to the relative benefits received by the Company and all officers, directors or employees of the Company, other than Indemnitee, who are jointly liable with Indemnitee (or would be if joined in such action, suit or proceeding), on the one hand, and Indemnitee, on the other hand, from the transaction from which such action, suit or proceeding arose; **provided**, **however**, that the proportion determined on the basis of relative benefit may, to the extent necessary to conform to law, be further adjusted by reference to the relative fault of the Company and all officers, directors or employees of the Company other than Indemnitee who are jointly liable with Indemnitee (or would be if joined in such action, suit or proceeding), on the one hand, and Indemnitee, on the other hand, in connection with the events that resulted in such Expenses, judgments, fines or settlement amounts, as well as any other equitable considerations which applicable law may require to be considered. The relative fault of the Company and all officers, directors or employees of the Company, other than Indemnitee, who are jointly liable with Indemnitee (or would be if joined in such action, suit or proceeding), on the one hand, and Indemnitee, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, the degree to which their actions were motivated by intent to gain personal profit or advantage, the degree to which their liability is primary or secondary and the degree to which their conduct is active or passive.
>
> (c) **Indemnification of Claims of Contribution**. The Company hereby agrees to fully indemnify and hold Indemnitee harmless from any claims of contribution that may be brought by officers, directors or employees of the Company, other than Indemnitee, who may be jointly liable with Indemnitee.
>
> (d) **Contribution for Indemnifiable Events**. To the fullest extent permissible under applicable law, if the indemnification provided for in this Agreement is unavailable to Indemnitee for any reason whatsoever, the Company, in lieu of indemnifying Indemnitee, shall contribute to the amount incurred by Indemnitee, whether for judgments, fines, penalties, amounts paid in settlement and/or for Expenses, in connection with any claim relating to an indemnifiable event under this Agreement, in such proportion as is deemed fair and reasonable in light of all of the circumstances of such Proceeding in order to reflect (i) the relative benefits received by the Company and Indemnitee as a result of the event(s) and/or transaction(s) giving cause to such Proceeding; and/or (ii) the relative fault of the Company (and its directors, officers, employees and agents) and Indemnitee in connection with such event(s) and/or transaction(s).

4. **Indemnification for Expenses of a Witness**. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, to the extent that Indemnitee is, by reason of Indemnitee's Corporate Status, a witness, or is made (or asked to) respond to discovery requests, in any Proceeding to which Indemnitee is not a party, he or she shall be indemnified against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee or on Indemnitee's behalf in connection therewith.

5. **Advancement of Expenses**. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Company shall advance all Expenses incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in connection with any Proceeding by reason of Indemnitee's Corporate Status within thirty (30) days after the receipt by the Company of a statement or statements from Indemnitee requesting such advance or advances from time to time, whether prior to or after final disposition of such Proceeding and regardless of such Indemnitee's ability to repay any such amounts in the event of an ultimate determination that Indemnitee is not entitled thereto. Such statement or statements shall reasonably evidence the Expenses incurred by Indemnitee and shall include or be preceded or accompanied by a written undertaking by or on behalf of Indemnitee to repay any Expenses advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judgment or other final adjudication under the provisions of any applicable law (as to which all rights of appeal therefrom have been exhausted or lapsed) that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified against such Expenses under the provisions of this Agreement, the Organizational Documents, applicable law or otherwise. Any advances and undertakings to repay pursuant to this **Section 5** shall be unsecured and interest free. This Section 5 shall be subject to Section 13 and shall not apply to any claim made by Indemnitee for which indemnity is excluded pursuant to Section 9.

6. **Procedures and Presumptions for Determination of Entitlement to Indemnification**. It is the intent of this Agreement to secure for Indemnitee rights of indemnity that are as favorable as may be permitted under the Delaware General Company Law ("**DGCL**") and public policy of the State of Delaware. Accordingly, the parties agree that the following procedures and presumptions shall apply in the event of any question as to whether Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement:

> (a) **Written Request of Indemnification**. To obtain indemnification under this Agreement, Indemnitee shall submit to the General Counsel of the Company a written request, including therein or therewith such documentation and information as is reasonably available to Indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification. The General Counsel of the Company shall, promptly upon receipt of such a request for indemnification, advise the Board in writing that Indemnitee has requested indemnification. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any failure of Indemnitee to provide such a request to the Company, or to provide such a request in a timely fashion, shall not relieve the Company of any liability that it may have to Indemnitee unless, and to the extent that, such failure actually and materially prejudices the interests of the Company.
>
> (b) **Determination of Indemnification**. Upon written request by Indemnitee for indemnification pursuant to the first sentence of **Section 6(a)** hereof, a determination with respect to Indemnitee's entitlement thereto shall be made in the specific case by one of the following four methods, which shall be at the election of the Board: (i) by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors, even though less than a quorum, (ii) by a committee of Disinterested Directors designated by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors, even though less than a quorum, (iii) if there are no Disinterested Directors, or if the Disinterested Directors so direct, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Board, a copy of which shall be delivered to Indemnitee, or (iv) if so directed by the Board, by the stockholders of the Company; **provided**, **however**, that if a Change in Control has occurred, the determination with respect to Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification shall be made by Independent Counsel.
>
> (c) **Independent Counsel**. In the event the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel, the Independent Counsel shall be selected as provided in this **Section 6(c)**. If a Change in Control has not occurred, the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the Board (including a vote of a majority of the Disinterested Directors, if obtainable), and the Company shall give written notice advising the Indemnitee of the identity of the Independent Counsel so selected. Indemnitee may, within ten (10) days after such written notice of selection shall have been given, deliver to the Company a written objection to such selection; **provided**, **however**, that such objection may be asserted only on the ground that the Independent Counsel so selected does not meet the requirements of "Independent Counsel" as defined in **Section 14** of this Agreement, and the objection shall set forth with particularity the factual basis of such assertion. Absent a proper and timely objection, the person so selected shall act as Independent Counsel. If a written objection is made, the Independent Counsel selected may not serve as Independent Counsel unless and until such objection is withdrawn or a court has determined that such objection is without merit. If a Change in Control has occurred, the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the Indemnitee (unless the Indemnitee shall request that such selection be made by the Board, in which event the preceding sentence shall apply), and approved by the Board (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld). If (i) an Independent Counsel is to make the determination of entitlement pursuant to this **Section 6**, and (ii) within twenty (20) days after submission by Indemnitee of a written request for indemnification pursuant to **Section 6(a)** hereof, no Independent Counsel shall have been selected and not objected to, either the Company or Indemnitee may petition the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or other court of competent jurisdiction for resolution of any objection which shall have been made by Indemnitee to the Company's selection of Independent Counsel and/or for the appointment as Independent Counsel of a person selected by the court or by such other person as the court shall designate, and the person with respect to whom all objections are so resolved or the person so appointed shall act as Independent Counsel under **Section 6(b)** hereof. The Company shall pay any and all reasonable fees and expenses of Independent Counsel incurred by such Independent Counsel in connection with acting pursuant to **Section 6(b)** hereof, and the Company shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses incident to the procedures of this **Section 6(c)**, regardless of the manner in which such Independent Counsel was selected or appointed.
>
> (d)\* **\*Presumption of Indemnification**. In making a determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification hereunder, the person or persons or entity making such determination shall presume that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement. Anyone seeking to overcome this presumption shall have the burden of proof and the burden of persuasion by clear and convincing evidence. Neither the failure of the Company (including by its directors or independent legal counsel) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of any action pursuant to this Agreement that indemnification is proper in the circumstances because Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual determination by the Company (including by its directors or independent legal counsel) that Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct.
>
> (e)\* **\*Presumption of Good Faith**. Indemnitee shall be deemed to have acted in good faith if Indemnitee's action is based on the records or books of account of the Enterprise, including financial statements, or on information supplied to Indemnitee by the officers of the Enterprise in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel for the Enterprise or on information or records given or reports made to the Enterprise by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected by the Enterprise. The provisions of this **Section 6(e)** shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the other circumstances in which the Indemnitee may be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in this Agreement. In addition, the knowledge and/or actions, or failure to act, of any director, officer, agent or employee of the Enterprise shall not be imputed to Indemnitee for purposes of determining the right to indemnification under this Agreement. Whether or not the foregoing provisions of this **Section 6(e)** are satisfied, it shall in any event be presumed that Indemnitee has at all times acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company. Anyone seeking to overcome this presumption shall have the burden of proof and the burden of persuasion by clear and convincing evidence.
>
> (f)\* **\*Timing**. If the person, persons or entity empowered or selected under this **Section 6** to determine whether Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification shall not have made a determination within sixty (60) days after receipt by the Company of the request therefor, the requisite determination of entitlement to indemnification shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be deemed to have been made and Indemnitee shall be entitled to such indemnification absent (i) a misstatement by Indemnitee of a material fact, or an omission of a material fact necessary to make Indemnitee's statement not materially misleading, in connection with the request for indemnification, or (ii) a prohibition of such indemnification under applicable law; **provided**, **however**, that such sixty (60) day period may be extended for a reasonable time, not to exceed an additional thirty (30) days, if the person, persons or entity making such determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification in good faith requires such additional time to obtain or evaluate documentation and/or information relating thereto; and **provided**, **further**, that the foregoing provisions of this **Section 6(f)** shall not apply if the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by the stockholders pursuant to **Section 6(b)** of this Agreement and if (A) within fifteen (15) days after receipt by the Company of the request for such determination, the Board or the Disinterested Directors, if appropriate, resolve to submit such determination to the stockholders for their consideration at an annual meeting thereof to be held within seventy-five (75) days after such receipt and such determination is made thereat, or (B) a special meeting of stockholders is called within fifteen (15) days after such receipt for the purpose of making such determination, such meeting is held for such purpose within sixty (60) days after having been so called and such determination is made thereat.
>
> (g)\* **\*Cooperation**. Indemnitee shall cooperate with the person, persons or entity making such determination with respect to Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification, including providing to such person, persons or entity upon reasonable advance request any documentation or information, which is not privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure and which is reasonably available to Indemnitee and reasonably necessary to such determination. Any Independent Counsel or member of the Board shall act reasonably and in good faith in making a determination regarding Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification under this Agreement. Any costs or expenses (including attorneys' fees and disbursements) incurred by Indemnitee in so cooperating with the person, persons or entity making such determination shall be borne by the Company (irrespective of the determination as to Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification) and the Company hereby indemnifies and agrees to hold Indemnitee harmless therefrom.
>
> (h)\* **\*Presumption of Success on the Merits**. The Company acknowledges that a settlement or other disposition short of final judgment may be successful if it permits a party to avoid expense, delay, distraction, disruption and uncertainty. In the event that any action, claim or proceeding to which Indemnitee is a party is resolved in any manner other than by adverse judgment against Indemnitee (including, without limitation, settlement of such action, claim or proceeding with or without payment of money or other consideration) it shall be presumed that Indemnitee has been successful on the merits or otherwise in such action, suit or proceeding. Anyone seeking to overcome this presumption shall have the burden of proof and the burden of persuasion by clear and convincing evidence.
>
> (i) **Termination of Proceeding**. The termination of any Proceeding or of any claim, issue or matter therein, by judgment, order, settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not (except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement) of itself adversely affect the right of Indemnitee to indemnification or create a presumption that Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner which he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company or, with respect to any criminal Proceeding, that Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe that Indemnitee's conduct was unlawful.

7. **Remedies of Indemnitee**.

> (a) **Disputes**. In the event of any dispute between Indemnitee and the Company hereunder as to entitlement to indemnification or advancement of Expenses, including where (i) a determination is made pursuant to **Section 6** of this Agreement that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification, (ii) payment is not timely made following a determination of entitlement to indemnification pursuant to **Section 6** of this Agreement, (iii) an advancement of Expenses is not timely made pursuant to **Section 5** of this Agreement, (iv) a contribution payment is not timely made pursuant to **Section 3** of this Agreement, or (v) no determination as to entitlement to indemnification is timely made pursuant to **Section 6** of this Agreement and payment is not timely made after entitlement is deemed to have been determined pursuant to **Section 6(f)**, Indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Company seeking an adjudication of entitlement to such indemnification or advancement of Expenses, and any such suit shall be brought in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or in any other court of competent jurisdiction. Alternatively, Indemnitee, at such person's option, may seek an award in arbitration to be conducted by a single arbitrator pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. Except as set forth herein, the provisions of Delaware law (without regard to its conflict of law rules) shall apply to any such arbitration. The Company shall not oppose Indemnitee's right to seek any such adjudication or award in arbitration.
>
> (b) **Burden of Proof**. In the event that a determination shall have been made pursuant to **Section 6(b)** of this Agreement that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification, any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this **Section 7** shall be conducted in all respects as a de novo trial, or arbitration, on the merits, and Indemnitee shall not be prejudiced by reason of the adverse determination under **Section 6(b)**. In any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this **Section 7**, the Company shall have the burden of proving that Indemnitee was not entitled to the requested indemnification, advancement or payment of Expenses. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for Expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the Company) that Indemnitee has not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible under this Agreement, the Organizational Documents or the DGCL for the Company to indemnify Indemnitee for the amount claimed. Neither the failure of the Company (including the Board, Independent Counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification or advancement is proper in the circumstances because Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in this Agreement, the Organizational Documents or the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the Company (including the Board, Independent Counsel, or its stockholders) that Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that Indemnitee has not met any applicable standard of conduct. If successful, in whole or in part, Indemnitee shall also be entitled to be paid the Expenses of prosecuting such action to the fullest extent permitted by law.
>
> (c) **Binding Effect**. If a determination shall have been made pursuant to **Section 6(b)** of this Agreement that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, the Company shall be bound by such determination in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this **Section 7**, absent (i) a misstatement by Indemnitee of a material fact, or an omission of a material fact necessary to make Indemnitee's misstatement not materially misleading in connection with the application for indemnification, or (ii) a prohibition of such indemnification under applicable law.
>
> (d) **Remedies for Breaches of this Agreement**. In the event that Indemnitee, pursuant to this **Section 7**, seeks a judicial adjudication of Indemnitee's rights under, or to recover damages for breach of, this Agreement, or to recover under any directors' and officers' liability insurance policies maintained by the Company, the Company shall pay on Indemnitee's behalf, in advance, any and all expenses (of the types described in the definition of Expenses in **Section 14** of this Agreement) actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee in such judicial adjudication to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.
>
> (e) **Binding Effect of this Agreement**. The Company shall be precluded from asserting in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this **Section 7** that the procedures and presumptions of this Agreement are not valid, binding and enforceable and shall stipulate in any such court or before any such arbitrator that the Company is bound by all the provisions of this Agreement. It is the intent of the Company that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Indemnitee not be required to incur legal fees or other Expenses associated with the interpretation, enforcement or defense of Indemnitee's rights under this Agreement by litigation or otherwise because the cost and expense thereof would substantially detract from the benefits intended to be extended to the Indemnitee hereunder. The Company shall indemnify Indemnitee against any and all Expenses and, if requested by Indemnitee, shall timely advance, to the extent permitted by law, such expenses to Indemnitee, which are incurred by Indemnitee in connection with any action brought by Indemnitee for indemnification or advance of Expenses from the Company under this Agreement or under any directors' and officers' liability insurance policies maintained by the Company, regardless of whether Indemnitee ultimately is determined to be entitled to such indemnification, advancement of Expenses or insurance recovery, as the case may be.
>
> (f) **Final Disposition**. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no determination as to entitlement to indemnification under this Agreement shall be required to be made prior to the final disposition of the Proceeding.

8. **Non-Exclusivity; Survival of Rights; Insurance; Primacy of Indemnification; Subrogation**.

> (a) **Non-Exclusive Rights**. The rights of indemnification and to receive advancement of expenses as provided by this Agreement shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which Indemnitee may at any time be entitled under applicable law, the Organizational Documents, any agreement, a vote of stockholders, a resolution of directors or otherwise, of the Company. No amendment, alteration or repeal of this Agreement or of any provision hereof shall limit or restrict any right of Indemnitee under this Agreement in respect of any action taken or omitted by such Indemnitee in such person's Corporate Status prior to such amendment, alteration or repeal. To the extent that a change in the DGCL, whether by statute or judicial decision, permits greater indemnification than would be afforded currently under the Organizational Documents and this Agreement, it is the intent of the parties hereto that Indemnitee shall enjoy by this Agreement the greater benefits so afforded by such change. No right or remedy herein conferred is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every other right and remedy shall be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other right or remedy.
>
> (b) **D&O Liability Insurance**. The Company shall obtain and maintain in effect during the entire period for which the Company is obligated to indemnify Indemnitee under this Agreement, one or more policies of insurance ("**D&O Liability Insurance**") with one or more reputable insurance companies to provide the directors and officers of the Company with standard coverage to ensure the Company's performance of its indemnification obligations under this Agreement. Indemnitee shall be covered by such policy or policies in accordance with its or their terms to the maximum extent of the coverage available for any such director or officer under such policy or policies. In all such insurance policies, Indemnitee shall be named as an insured in such a manner as to provide Indemnitee with the same rights and benefits as are accorded to the most favorably insured of the Company's directors and officers. At the time of the receipt of a notice of a claim pursuant to the terms hereof, the Company shall give prompt notice of the commencement of such proceeding to the insurers in accordance with the procedures set forth in the respective policies. The Company shall thereafter take all necessary or desirable action to cause such insurers to pay, on behalf of Indemnitee, all amounts payable as a result of such proceeding in accordance with the terms of such policies. Upon request by Indemnitee, the Company shall provide copies of all policies of D&O Liability Insurance obtained and maintained in accordance with the foregoing. The Company shall promptly notify Indemnitee of any changes in such insurance coverage.
>
> (c) **Subrogation**. In the event of any payment under this Agreement, the Company shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of Indemnitee, who shall execute all papers required and take all action necessary to secure such rights, including execution of such documents as are necessary to enable the Company to bring suit to enforce such rights.
>
> (d) **Double Recovery**. The Company shall not be liable under this Agreement to make any payment of amounts otherwise indemnifiable hereunder if and to the extent that Indemnitee has otherwise actually received such payment under any insurance policy, contract, agreement or otherwise.
>
> (e) **Sources of Recovery**. The Company's obligation to indemnify or advance Expenses hereunder to Indemnitee who is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent of any other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other Enterprise shall be reduced by any amount Indemnitee has actually received as indemnification or advancement of expenses from such other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise.
>
> (f) **Third-Party Indemnification**. The Company hereby acknowledges that Indemnitee has or may from time to time obtain certain rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and/or insurance provided by one or more third parties (collectively, the "**Third-Party Indemnitors**"). The Company hereby agrees that it is the indemnitor of first resort (*i.e.,* its obligations to Indemnitee are primary and any obligation of the Third-Party Indemnitors to advance expenses or to provide indemnification for the same expenses or liabilities incurred by Indemnitee are secondary), and that the Company will not assert that the Indemnitee must seek expense advancement or reimbursement, or indemnification, from any Third-Party Indemnitor before the Company must perform its expense advancement and reimbursement, and indemnification obligations, under this Agreement. No advancement or payment by the Third-Party Indemnitors on behalf of Indemnitee with respect to any claim for which Indemnitee has sought indemnification from the Company shall affect the foregoing. The Third-Party Indemnitors shall be subrogated to the extent of such advancement or payment to all of the rights of recovery which Indemnitee would have had against the Company if the Third-Party Indemnitors had not advanced or paid any amount to or on behalf of Indemnitee.
