# SUPPLEMENTAL COMPENSATION AGREEMENT

This Supplemental Compensation Agreement ("Agreement") is entered as of [Date] (the "Effective Date") and made between **[Entity-name]** (the "Company") and **[Recipient-name]** ("Employee"). The parties agree that the Company desires to provide supplemental compensation for Employee for the expanded scope of work outlined below and will compensate him as agreed herein.

1. **Employee's Obligations**. Employee hereby agrees to [Recipient-services] (the "Project"). The Parties agree that Employee will substantially resign and conclude his involvement upon the deposit of the supplemental compensation funds ($[Pay-amount]) and that the compensation contemplated herein is, in part, based upon the loss of significant future benefits, opportunities, and income were he to continue his present engagement.

Employee agrees to timely advise the Company if he needs additional talent or team members to facilitate the completion of the Project in a timely manner or if he requires any additional equipment that is crucial to the Project.

Employee agrees to use his best efforts in order to successfully complete the Project, but the parties agree and understand that there is no guarantee that the Project will succeed despite Employee's and the others' best efforts.

2. **Independent Contractor Relationship**. The Parties agree that the relationship between the Parties is that of an independent contractor, and nothing in this Agreement is intended to, nor should be construed to, create a partnership, joint venture, agency or engagement relationship between the Company and Employee. Employee will not be entitled to any benefits that the Company may make available to his other employees, including, but not limited to, group health or life insurance, profit-sharing or retirement benefits. Because Employee is an independent contractor, the Company will not withhold or make payments for social security, make un-engagement insurance or disability insurance contributions, or obtain workers' compensation insurance on behalf of Employee.

3. **Additional Work/Projects**. The Parties agree that on [Date-negotiation], they will negotiate in good faith about ongoing roles and responsibilities regarding the Project and other projects.

4. **Breach of Agreement**. In the event of a breach of this Agreement the wronged party shall be entitled to all remedies available to him under the laws of the State of [Entity-state], including monetary damages for all proven damages.

> (a) _Breach by the Company_. The Company shall be in breach of this Agreement if the Company fails to deposit the funds identified herein. In the event that the Company does not make the initial $[Pay-amount] payment upon execution of this agreement, Employee, at his option, may continue to work on the Project but shall be under no obligation to continue any work on the Project and the Parties agree that Employee' damages shall be $[Pay-amount].
>
> (b) _Breach by Employee_. Employee shall be in breach of the Agreement if he fails to provide his best efforts to the Project or fails to notify the Company of the need for talent or other material to complete the Project.

5. **Covenant Not to Sue/Dispute Resolution/Attorney's Fees**. The parties covenant that under no conditions will either party or any affiliate file any action against the other (except requests for injunctive or other equitable relief only) in any forum but instead agree to resolve any disagreement regarding the implementation of the Agreement or an alleged breach by a party by mandatory arbitration. The parties further choose to use Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services ("JAMS") in [Entity-city], [Entity-state], as the agreed arbitrator in this matter. Either party may request arbitration of any dispute by sending notice to the other party, in writing, of the demand for arbitration.

In the event of any arbitration of a dispute between the parties, the Company agrees to pre-pay, after notice of arbitration has been sent, $50,000.00 (fifty thousand dollars USD) to the attorneys of Employee's choice. Following arbitration the arbitrator may award attorney's fees to the prevailing party, including the reimbursement of any attorney's fees that were pre-paid in the dispute.

6. **Executed Separately**. This Agreement may be executed in separate parts and at different times, each of which will be deemed an original, but all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument. Counterparts may be delivered via facsimile, electronic mail (including pdf or any electronic signature complying with the U.S. Federal ESIGN Act of 2000).
