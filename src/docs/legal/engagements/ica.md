> - Consultant has no expectation of privacy with respect to Company’s telecommunications, networking or information processing systems (including stored computer files, email messages and voice messages) and that Consultant’s activities, including the sending or receiving of any files or messages, on or using those systems may be monitored, and the contents of such files and messages may be reviewed and disclosed, at any time, without notice.

> **2. Compensation.**

Company will pay Consultant the fee set forth in each Project Assignment for Services rendered pursuant to this Agreement as Consultant’s sole compensation for such Services. Consultant will be reimbursed only for expenses that are expressly provided for in a Project Assignment or that have been approved in advance in writing by Company, provided Consultant has furnished such documentation for authorized expenses as Company may reasonably request. Payment of Consultant’s fees and expenses will be in accordance with the applicable Project Assignment. Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, Consultant will be paid fees on the basis stated in the Project Assignment(s) for work that has been completed. Unless otherwise provided in a Project Assignment, payment to Consultant of undisputed fees will be due 30 days following Company’s receipt of an invoice that contains accurate records of the work performed that are sufficient to substantiate the invoiced fees.

Consultant hereby irrevocably assigns to Company all right, title and interest worldwide in and to any deliverables specified in a Project Assignment and to any ideas, concepts, processes, discoveries, developments, formulae, information, materials, improvements, designs, artwork, content, software programs, other copyrightable works, and any other work product created, conceived or developed by Consultant (whether alone or jointly with others) for Company during or before the term of this Agreement, including all copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights therein (collectively, the “Work Product”). Consultant retains no rights to use the Work Product and agrees not to challenge the validity of Company’s ownership of the Work Product. Consultant agrees to execute, at Company’s request and expense, all documents and other instruments necessary or desirable to confirm such assignment, including without limitation, any copyright assignment or patent assignment provided by the Company. Consultant hereby irrevocably appoints Company as Consultant’s attorney-in-fact for the purpose of executing such documents on Consultant’s behalf, which appointment is coupled with an interest. At Company’s request, Consultant will promptly record any such patent assignment with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Company will reimburse Consultant for any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses actually incurred by Consultant in fulfilling its obligations under this section. Consultant will deliver each item of Work Product specified in each Project Assignment and disclose promptly in writing to Company all other Work Product.

> **4. Other Rights.**

If Consultant has any rights, including without limitation “artist’s rights” or “moral rights,” in the Work Product that cannot be assigned, Consultant hereby unconditionally and irrevocably grants to Company an exclusive (even as to Consultant), worldwide, fully paid and royalty-free, irrevocable, perpetual license, with rights to sublicense through multiple tiers of sublicensees, to use, reproduce, distribute, create derivative works of, publicly perform and publicly display the Work Product in any medium or format, whether now known or later developed. In the event that Consultant has any rights in the Work Product that cannot be assigned or licensed, Consultant unconditionally and irrevocably waives the enforcement of such rights, and all claims and causes of action of any kind against Company or Company’s customers.

> **5. License to Preexisting IP.**

Consultant agrees not to use or incorporate into Work Product any intellectual property developed by any third party or by Consultant other than in the course of performing services for Company (“Preexisting IP”) unless the Preexisting IP has been specifically identified and described in the applicable Project Assignment, such as in research reports in which the sources of research are cited. In the event Consultant uses or incorporates Preexisting IP into Work Product, Consultant hereby grants to Company a non-exclusive, worldwide, fully-paid and royalty-free, irrevocable, perpetual license, with the right to sublicense through multiple tiers of sublicensees, to use, reproduce, distribute, create derivative works of, publicly perform and publicly display in any medium or format, whether now known or later developed, such Preexisting IP incorporated or used in Work Product.

> **6. Representations and Warranties.**

Consultant represents and warrants that: (a) the Services will be performed in a professional manner and in accordance with the industry standards and the Work Product will comply with the requirements set forth in the applicable Project Assignment, (b) the Work Product will be an original work of Consultant, (c) Consultant has the right and unrestricted ability to assign ownership of Work Product to Company as set forth in Section 3 (including without limitation the right to assign the ownership of any Work Product created by Consultant’s employees or contractors), (d) neither the Work Product nor any element thereof will infringe upon or misappropriate any copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret, right of publicity or privacy, or any other proprietary right of any person, whether contractual, statutory or common law, (e) Consultant has an unqualified right to grant to Company the license to Preexisting IP set forth in Section 5, (f) none of the Work Product incorporates any software code licensed under the GNU General Public License or Lesser General Public License or any other license that, by its terms, requires or conditions the use or distribution of such code on the disclosure, licensing, or distribution of any source code owned or licensed by Company, except as expressly agreed by the Company in writing, and (g) Consultant will comply with all applicable federal, state, local and foreign laws governing self-employed individuals, including laws requiring the payment of taxes, such as income and employment taxes, and social security, disability, and other contributions. Consultant further represents and warrants that Consultant is self-employed in an independently established trade, occupation, or business; maintains and operates a business that is separate and independent from Company’s business; holds itself, himself or herself out to the public as independently competent and available to provide applicable services similar to the Services; has obtained and/or expects to obtain clients or customers other than Company for whom Consultant performs services; and will perform work for Company that Consultant understands is outside the usual course of Company’s business. Consultant agrees to indemnify and hold Company harmless from any and all damages, costs, claims, expenses or other liability (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from or relating to the breach or alleged breach by Consultant of the representations and warranties set forth in this Section 6.

> **7. Independent Contractor Relationship.**

Consultant’s relationship with Company is that of an independent contractor, and nothing in this Agreement is intended to, or should be construed to, create a partnership, joint venture, agency (other than creative services agency, overseeing development of Company creative assets) or employment relationship between Company and any of Consultant’s employees or agents. Consultant is not authorized to make any representation, contract or commitment on behalf of Company. Consultant (if Consultant is an individual) and Consultant’s employees will not be entitled to any of the benefits that Company may make available to its employees, including, but not limited to, group health or life insurance, profit-sharing or retirement benefits. Because Consultant is an independent contractor, Company will not withhold or make payments for social security, make unemployment insurance or disability insurance contributions, or obtain workers’ compensation insurance on behalf of Consultant. Consultant is solely responsible for, and will file, on a timely basis, all tax returns and payments required to be filed with, or made to, any federal, state or local tax authority with respect to the performance of Services and receipt of fees under this Agreement. Consultant is solely responsible for, and must maintain adequate records of, expenses incurred in the course of performing Services under this Agreement. No part of Consultant’s compensation will be subject to withholding by Company for the payment of any social security, federal, state or any other employee payroll taxes. Company will regularly report amounts paid to Consultant by filing Form 1099-MISC with the Internal Revenue Service as required by law. If, notwithstanding the foregoing, Consultant is reclassified as an employee of Company, or any affiliate of Company, by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Department of Labor, or any other federal or state or foreign agency as the result of any administrative or judicial proceeding, Consultant agrees that Consultant will not, as the result of such reclassification, be entitled to or eligible for, on either a prospective or retrospective basis, any employee benefits under any plans or programs established or maintained by Company.

> **8. Confidential Information.**

During the term of this Agreement and thereafter Consultant (i) will not use or permit the use of Company’s Confidential Information in any manner or for any purpose not expressly set forth in this Agreement, (ii) will hold such Confidential Information in confidence and protect it from unauthorized use and disclosure, and (iii) will not disclose such Confidential Information to any third parties except as set forth in this section and in Section 9 below. Consultant will protect Company’s Confidential Information from unauthorized use, access or disclosure in the same manner as Consultant protects its own confidential information of a similar nature, but in no event will it exercise less than reasonable care. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other agreement between Company and Consultant, nothing in this Agreement shall limit Consultant’s right to report possible violations of law or regulation with any federal, state, or local government agency. “Confidential Information” as used in this Agreement means all information disclosed by Company to Consultant, whether during or before the term of this Agreement, that is not generally known in the Company’s trade or industry and will include, without limitation: (a) concepts and ideas relating to the development and distribution of content in any medium or to the current, future and proposed products or services of Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates; (b) trade secrets, drawings, inventions, know-how, software programs, and software source documents; (c) information regarding plans for research, development, new service offerings or products, marketing and selling, business plans, business forecasts, budgets and unpublished financial statements, licenses and distribution arrangements, prices and costs, suppliers and customers; (d) existence of any business discussions, negotiations or agreements between the parties; and (e) any information regarding the skills and compensation of employees, contractors or other agents of Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates. Confidential Information also includes proprietary or confidential information of any third party who may disclose such information to Company or Consultant in the course of Company’s business. Confidential Information does not include information that (x) is or becomes a part of the public domain through no act or omission of Consultant, (y) is disclosed to Consultant by a third party without restrictions on disclosure, or (z) was in Consultant’s lawful possession without obligation of confidentiality prior to the disclosure and was not obtained by Consultant either directly or indirectly from Company. In addition, this section will not be construed to prohibit disclosure of Confidential Information to the extent that such disclosure is required by law or valid order of a court or other governmental authority; provided, however, that Consultant will first have given notice to Company and will have made a reasonable effort to obtain a protective order requiring that the Confidential Information so disclosed be used only for the purposes for which the order was issued. All Confidential Information furnished to Consultant by Company is the sole and exclusive property of or its suppliers or customers. Upon request by Company, Consultant agrees to promptly deliver to Company the original and any copies of the Confidential Information. Notwithstanding the foregoing nondisclosure obligations, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Section 1833(b), Consultant will not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that is made: (1) in confidence to a federal, state, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney, and solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (2) in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. Consultant understand that the Company intends to set up a foundation dedicated to the public good and in order to accomplish the goals of the Company the founders, owners and other persons involved in the Company wish to remain anonymous in order to avoid distracting attention or resources form the Company’s aims. Consultant agree he/she/they shall not disclose, publish or otherwise make know the identity of any of the principles, managers, owners or other persons who are involved in the Company to any third party or to any other Consultant who may also be working for the Company, and that the identities of the Owners, Founders or Managers shall be considered both “confidential information” and “personal information” under the terms of this Agreement.

- 8.1 Personal Information. With respect to any Confidential Information that constitutes personal data, personal information, personally identifiable information or similar information under applicable privacy or data security laws (collectively, “Personal Information”), Consultant shall not (i) sell Personal Information or (ii) retain, use or disclose Personal Information for any purpose other than the specific purpose of providing the Services. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing prohibits Consultant from “selling” Personal Information, as defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (as amended, the “CCPA”), and from retaining, using, or disclosing Personal Information outside of the direct business relationship between Consultant and Company or for a “commercial purpose” (as defined in the CCPA). Consultant hereby certifies that it understands the obligations under this Section 8.1 and will comply with them. (a) Consultant shall use reasonable security measures appropriate to the nature of any Personal Information in its possession or control to protect the Personal Information from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure. (b) The parties acknowledge and agree that Consultant’s access to Personal Information is not part of the consideration exchanged by the parties in respect of the Agreement. (c) If any individual contacts Consultant to make a request pertaining to their Personal Information, Consultant shall promptly forward the request to the Company and shall not respond to the individual except as instructed by Company. Consultant shall promptly take such actions and provide such information as Company may request to help Company fulfill requests of individuals to exercise their rights under the applicable privacy or data security laws, including, without limitation, requests to access, delete, opt-out of the sale of, or receive information about the processing of, Personal Information pertaining to them. Consultant agrees to cooperate with Company to further amend the Agreement as may be necessary to address compliance with applicable privacy or data security laws.

- 8.2 Breach of the Confidentiality/Personal Information and Liquidated Damages. The parties understand and agree that the personal information and identity of the Owners, Founders and Managers of the Company is of paramount importance and that such disclosure may harm the goals of the Company and the future success of its endeavors in terms of its non-profit work. These damages may be difficult to quantify as they include the good-will of the Company and its various anticipated projects as well as an effect the value of any tokens on the block-chain that do not necessarily conform to traditional notions of “damages.” Therefore the parties agree that any breach of the duty to not disclose the personal information and identity of the Owners, Founders and Managers shall be subject to reasonable liquidated damages in the amount of $100,000.00 (one hundred thousand dollars).

> **9. Consultant’s Employees, Consultant and Agents.**

Company reserves the right to refuse or limit Consultant’s use of any employee, Consultant or agent or to require Consultant to remove any employee, Consultant or agent already engaged in the performance of the Services. Company’s exercise of such right will in no way limit Consultant’s obligations under this Agreement.
