According to the [IRS](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/definition-of-a-trust):

> _In general, a trust is a relationship in which one person holds title to property, subject to an obligation to keep or use the property for the benefit of another._

Put otherwise, a trust is a right in property which is held by one party for the benefit of another. The _trustee_ holds title to the trust property, and the _beneficiary_ receives the benefits of the trust. The person or entity transferring property to the trust is the _settlor_.

- Trusts do not have legal personhood. The trustee is the principal actor and carries out the purposes of the trust in his own name. This can be beneficial from a tax perspectiveâ€”beneficiaries are often taxed as the direct owners of the trust property.
- Trusts are flexible. Usually, provisions of a trust can be whatever is agreed between the settlor and the trustee.
- Trusts can be valuable for maintaining confidentiality. [The terms of a Trust Agreement](/legal/trusts/trust.md) are usually not accessible to third parties. Instead, a [Declaration of Trust](/legal/trusts/declaration-of-trust.md) which states the high-level terms of the agreement may be notarized and provided to 3rd parties who are required to validate ownership. The trustee may be required to provide the Certificate of Trust to a bank in order to open an account in which to deposit the property.
- Typically, trusts do not need to be filed. Unless there is a lawsuit concerning your trust, it usually won't become a matter of public record.

Trusts are established to provide legal protection for the trustor's assets, to make sure they are distributed according to the wishes of the trustors, to save time, to reduce paperwork, to avoid or reduce inheritance or estate taxes, to shield assets from 3rd parties, or a number of other applications.

Trusts are versatile legal devices: there are at least six broad categories of trust, including living, testamentary, funded, unfunded, revocable, and irrevocable.

## For Your Project

Juicebox projects have facilitated some of the largest fundraisers of all time. A one-time fundraise may be accomplished via a [trust agreement](./Resources/trusts/trust.md) where as the contributors are the settlors, the individual who created the project is the trustee, and the beneficiary is the individual(s) who will receive the funds.

You can also use a trust for a [GoFundMe](https://www.gofundme.com/)-style fundraiser to pay for medical or other expenses for a family member, a friend, or even a pet.

Whether an attorney is available to help prepare the documents, or you edit the documents and make them available to the community, this device has substantial statutory law protecting the contributors and the beneficiary.

:::info
By statute, a trust may be established for a pet's lifetime, or in the case of multiple pets, the trust may provide for the care, alternative caregivers, and day-to-day requirements including emergency or extraordinary care for each pet. The term of such a trust extends through the lifetime of the last surviving pet, leaving our furry friend's progeny at the mercy of the elements.[^1]
