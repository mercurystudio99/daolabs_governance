# Ownerless Foundation (Nonprofit Corporation)

An ownerless foundation is managed by a council or a board, which can itself be directed by token holders, an advisory comittee, or something else. Board/council members have fiduciary obligations to the community, which can be to promote community or product growth and development.

- Typically, token holders do not have a direct ownership relationship with the foundation.
- Foundations are corporations, and thus have annual reporting filing requirements.
- Foundations have legal personhood.
- Founders may be responsible for liabilities not arising from the foundation, or for liabilities that founders cause the foundation to take on.
- Foundations are not typically used for raising capital.

## Nonprofit Status

According to the [IRS](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/exempt-organization-types):

> _Organizations organized and operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, testing for public safety, literary, educational, or other specified purposes and that meet certain other requirements are tax exempt under Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(3)._

There are specific requirements to receive this exemptionâ€”for an overview, read [_Exemption Requirements - 501(c)(3) Organizations_](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/exemption-requirements-501c3-organizations). In short, the organization must be operated **exclusively** for exempt purposes (such as those listed above), and none of its earnings may inure to any private shareholder or individual. Nonprofit corporations also have unique [filing requirements](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/annual-filing-and-forms).

If your project meets the criteria above, organizing as a nonprofit corporation can dramatically reduce or altogether eliminate your tax liability.

## For Your Project

Ownerless foundations can be effective for communities looking to delegate authority over certain assets (including tokens, intellectual property, or onchain assets) to a board or council with fiduciary duty to the wider community and its goals. Ownerless foundations are often utilized by protocol DAOs.
