Notice of any special meeting of the Board shall be given at least threeÂ (3) days prior to the meeting to each member of the Board except that a special meeting of the Board for the express purpose of amending either the Articles of Incorporation or amending the Bylaws of the Corporation shall require notice to be given at least ten (10) days prior to said meeting.

Oral notice is effective when received.

Members of the Board of Directors (or any committee designated by the Board) may participate in a meeting of such Board (or Committee) by means of a conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other at the same time and participation by such means shall constitute presence in person at the meeting.

3.13 **Unanimous Consent**.

## ARTICLE VI; INDEMNIFICATION.

6.1 **Right to Indemnification**. Each individual (hereinafter an "indemnitee") who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved (including, without limitation, as a witness) in any actual or threatened action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative and whether formal or informal (hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or that, while serving as a director or officer of the Corporation, he or she is or was also serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee or agent of another foreign or domestic corporation or of a foreign or domestic partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, whether the basis of the proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as such a director, officer, employee, partner, trustee, or agent or in any other capacity while serving as such director, officer, employee, partner, trustee, or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the full extent permitted by applicable law as then in effect, against all expense, liability and loss (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts to be paid in settlement) incurred or suffered by such indemnitee in connection therewith, and such indemnification shall continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee, partner, trustee, or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the indemnitee's heirs, executors and administrators; provided, however, that no indemnification shall be provided to any such indemnitee if the Corporation is prohibited by the Washington Nonprofit Corporation Act or other applicable law as then in effect from paying such indemnification; and provided, further, that except as provided in this Article with respect to proceedings seeking to enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify any such indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized or ratified by the Board of Directors. The right to indemnification conferred in this section shall be a contract right and shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition (hereinafter an "advancement of expenses"). Any advancement of expenses shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of a written undertaking (hereinafter an "undertaking"), by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this section and upon delivery to the Corporation of a written affirmation (hereinafter an "affirmation") by the indemnitee of his or her good faith belief that such indemnitee has met the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification by the Corporation pursuant to this article.

6.2 **Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit**. If a written claim for indemnification under this Article is not paid in full by the Corporation within sixty (60) days after the Corporation's receipt thereof, except in the case of a claim for an advancement of expenses, in which case the applicable period shall be twenty (20) days, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. If successful, in whole or in part, in any such suit or in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expenses of prosecuting or defending such suit. The indemnitee shall be presumed to be entitled to indemnification under this article upon submission of a written claim (and, in an action brought to enforce a claim for an advancement of expenses, where the required undertaking and affirmation have been tendered to the Corporation) and thereafter the Corporation shall have the burden of proof to overcome the presumption that the indemnitee is so entitled. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including the Board of Directors or independent legal counsel) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including the Board of Directors or independent legal counsel) that the indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification shall be a defense to the suit or create a presumption that the indemnitee is not so entitled.

6.3 **Nonexclusivity of Rights**. The right to indemnification and the advancement of expenses conferred in this article shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Corporation, general or specific action of the Board of Directors, contract or otherwise.

6.4 **Insurance, Contracts and Funding**. The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any individual who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or who, while a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a agent of another foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss asserted against or incurred by the individual in that capacity or arising from the individual's status as a director, officer, employee or agent, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the Washington Nonprofit Corporation Act. The Corporation may enter into contracts with any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation in furtherance of the provisions of this article and may create a trust fund, grant a security interest or use other means (including, without limitation, a letter of credit) to ensure the payment of such amounts as may be necessary to effect indemnification as provided in this article.

6.5 **Indemnification of Employees and Agents of the Corporation**. The Corporation may, by action of the Board of Directors, grant rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses to employees and agents of the Corporation with the same scope and effect as the provisions of this article with respect to the indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors and officers of the Corporation or pursuant to rights granted pursuant to, or provided by, the Washington Nonprofit Corporation Act or otherwise.

6.6 **Persons Serving Other Entities**. Any individual who is or was a director, officer or employee of the Corporation who, while a director, officer or employee of the Corporation, is or was serving (a) as a director or officer of another foreign or domestic corporation of which a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of its directors is held by the Corporation, (b) as a trustee of an employee benefit plan and the duties of the director or officer to the Corporation also impose duties on, or otherwise involve services by, the director or officer to the plan or to participants in or beneficiaries of the plan, or (c) in an executive or management capacity in a foreign or domestic partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise of which the Corporation is an equity interest holder or in which a wholly owned subsidiary of the Corporation is a general partner or has a majority ownership or interest shall be deemed to be so serving at the request of the Corporation and entitled to indemnification and advancement of expenses under this article.

> 1. Current Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws;
>
